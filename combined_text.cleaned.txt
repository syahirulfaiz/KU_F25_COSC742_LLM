While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions – something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art finetuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3’s few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general. Equal contribution yJohns Hopkins University, OpenAI Contents 1 Introduction 3 2 Approach 6 2.1 Model and Architectures......................................... 8 2.2 Training Dataset.............................................. 8 2.3 Training Process............................................. 9 2.4 Evaluation................................................. 10 3 Results 10 3.1 Language Modeling, Cloze, and Completion Tasks........................... 11 3.2 Closed Book Question Answering.................................... 13 3.3 Translation................................................ 14 3.4 Winograd-Style Tasks........................................... 16 3.5 Common Sense Reasoning........................................ 17 3.6 Reading Comprehension......................................... 18 3.7 SuperGLUE................................................ 18 3.8 NLI.................................................... 20 3.9 Synthetic and Qualitative Tasks...................................... 21 4 Measuring and Preventing Memorization Of Benchmarks 29 5 Limitations 33 6 Broader Impacts 34 6.1 Misuse of Language Models....................................... 35 6.2 Fairness, Bias, and Representation.................................... 36 6.3 Energy Usage............................................... 39 7 Related Work 39 8 Conclusion 40 A Details of Common Crawl Filtering 43 B Details of Model Training 43 C Details of Test Set Contamination Studies 43 D Total Compute Used to Train Language Models 46 E Human Quality Assessment of Synthetic News Articles 46 F Additional Samples from GPT-3 48 G Details of Task Phrasing and Specifications 50 H Results on All Tasks for All Model Sizes 63 1 Introduction Recent years have featured a trend towards pre-trained language representations in NLP systems, applied in increasingly flexible and task-agnostic ways for downstream transfer. First, single-layer representations were learned using word vectors [ MCCD13,PSM14 ] and fed to task-specific architectures, then RNNs with multiple layers of representations and contextual state were used to form stronger representations [ DL15,MBXS17,PNZtY18 ] (though still applied to task-specific architectures), and more recently pre-trained recurrent or transformer language models [ VSP+17] have been directly fine-tuned, entirely removing the need for task-specific architectures [RNSS18, DCLT18, HR18]. This last paradigm has led to substantial progress on many challenging NLP tasks such as reading comprehension, question answering, textual entailment, and many others, and has continued to advance based on new architectures and algorithms [ RSR+19,LOG+19,YDY+19,LCG+19]. However, a major limitation to this approach is that while the architecture is task-agnostic, there is still a need for task-specific datasets and task-specific fine-tuning: to achieve strong performance on a desired task typically requires fine-tuning on a dataset of thousands to hundreds of thousands of examples specific to that task. Removing this limitation would be desirable, for several reasons. First, from a practical perspective, the need for a large dataset of labeled examples for every new task limits the applicability of language models. There exists a very wide range of possible useful language tasks, encompassing anything from correcting grammar, to generating examples of an abstract concept, to critiquing a short story. For many of these tasks it is difficult to collect a large supervised training dataset, especially when the process must be repeated for every new task. Second, the potential to exploit spurious correlations in training data fundamentally grows with the expressiveness of the model and the narrowness of the training distribution. This can create problems for the pre-training plus fine-tuning paradigm, where models are designed to be large to absorb information during pre-training, but are then fine-tuned on very narrow task distributions. For instance [ HLW+20] observe that larger models do not necessarily generalize better out-of-distribution. There is evidence that suggests that the generalization achieved under this paradigm can be poor because the model is overly specific to the training distribution and does not generalize well outside it [YdC+19,MPL19 ]. Thus, the performance of fine-tuned models on specific benchmarks, even when it is nominally at human-level, may exaggerate actual performance on the underlying task [GSL+18, NK19]. Third, humans do not require large supervised datasets to learn most language tasks – a brief directive in natural language (e.g. “please tell me if this sentence describes something happy or something sad”) or at most a tiny number of demonstrations (e.g. “here are two examples of people acting brave; please give a third example of bravery”) is often

GPT-4 Technical Report OpenAI∗ Abstract We report the development of GPT-4, a large-scale, multimodal model which can accept image and text inputs and produce text outputs. While less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers. GPT-4 is a Transformerbased model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document. The post-training alignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was developing infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to accurately predict some aspects of GPT-4’s performance based on models trained with no more than 1/1,000th the compute of GPT-4. 1 Introduction This technical report presents GPT-4, a large multimodal model capable of processing image and text inputs and producing text outputs. Such models are an important area of study as they have the potential to be used in a wide range of applications, such as dialogue systems, text summarization, and machine translation. As such, they have been the subject of substantial interest and progress in recent years [1–34]. One of the main goals of developing such models is to improve their ability to understand and generate natural language text, particularly in more complex and nuanced scenarios. To test its capabilities in such scenarios, GPT-4 was evaluated on a variety of exams originally designed for humans. In these evaluations it performs quite well and often outscores the vast majority of human test takers. For example, on a simulated bar exam, GPT-4 achieves a score that falls in the top 10% of test takers. This contrasts with GPT-3.5, which scores in the bottom 10%. On a suite of traditional NLP benchmarks, GPT-4 outperforms both previous large language models and most state-of-the-art systems (which often have benchmark-specific training or hand-engineering). On the MMLU benchmark [ 35,36], an English-language suite of multiple-choice questions covering 57 subjects, GPT-4 not only outperforms existing models by a considerable margin in English, but also demonstrates strong performance in other languages. On translated variants of MMLU, GPT-4 surpasses the English-language state-of-the-art in 24 of 26 languages considered. We discuss these model capability results, as well as model safety improvements and results, in more detail in later sections. This report also discusses a key challenge of the project, developing deep learning infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to make predictions about the expected performance of GPT-4 (based on small runs trained in similar ways) that were tested against the final run to increase confidence in our training. Despite its capabilities, GPT-4 has similar limitations to earlier GPT models [ 1,37,38]: it is not fully reliable (e.g. can suffer from “hallucinations”), has a limited context window, and does not learn ∗Please cite this work as “OpenAI (2023)".

Correspondence regarding this technical report can be sent to gpt4-report@openai.comarXiv:2303.08774v6 [cs.CL] 4 Mar 2024 from experience. Care should be taken when using the outputs of GPT-4, particularly in contexts where reliability is important. GPT-4’s capabilities and limitations create significant and novel safety challenges, and we believe careful study of these challenges is an important area of research given the potential societal impact. This report includes an extensive system card (after the Appendix) describing some of the risks we foresee around bias, disinformation, over-reliance, privacy, cybersecurity, proliferation, and more. It also describes interventions we made to mitigate potential harms from the deployment of GPT-4, including adversarial testing with domain experts, and a model-assisted safety pipeline. 2 Scope and Limitations of this Technical Report This report focuses on the capabilities, limitations, and safety properties of GPT-4. GPT-4 is a Transformer-style model [ 39] pre-trained to predict the next token in a document, using both publicly available data (such as internet data) and data licensed from third-party providers. The model was then fine-tuned using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) [ 40]. Given both the competitive landscape and the safety implications of large-scale models like GPT-4, this report contains no further details about the architecture (including model size), hardware, training compute, dataset construction, training method, or similar. We are committed to independent auditing of our technologies, and shared some initial steps and ideas in this area in the system card accompanying this release.2We plan to make further technical details available to additional third parties who can advise us on how to weigh the competitive and safety considerations above against the scientific value of further transparency. 3 Predictable Scaling A large focus of the GPT-4 project was building a deep learning stack that scales predictably. The primary reason is that for very large training runs like GPT-4, it is not feasible to do extensive model-specific tuning. To address this, we developed infrastructure and optimization methods that have very predictable behavior across multiple scales. These improvements allowed us to reliably predict some aspects of the performance of GPT-4 from smaller models trained using 1,000×– 10,000×less compute. 3.1 Loss Prediction The final loss of properly-trained large language models is thought to be well approximated by power laws in the amount of compute used to train the model [41, 42, 2, 14, 15]. To verify the scalability of our optimization infrastructure, we predicted GPT-4’s final loss on our internal codebase (not part of the training set) by fitting a scaling law with an irreducible loss term (as in Henighan et al. [15]):L(C) =aCb+c,from models trained using the same methodology but using at most 10,000x less compute than GPT-4. This prediction was made shortly after the run started, without use of any partial results. The fitted scaling law predicted GPT-4’s final loss with high accuracy (Figure 1). 3.2 Scaling of Capabilities on HumanEval Having a sense of the capabilities of a model before training can improve decisions around alignment, safety, and deployment. In addition to predicting final loss, we developed methodology to predict more interpretable metrics of capability. One such metric is pass rate on the HumanEval dataset [ 43], which measures the ability to synthesize Python functions of varying complexity. We successfully predicted the pass rate on a subset of the HumanEval dataset by extrapolating from models trained with at most 1,000×less compute (Figure 2). For an individual problem in HumanEval, performance may occasionally worsen with scale. Despite these challenges, we find an approximate power law relationship −EP[log(pass _rate(C))] = α∗C−k 2In addition to the accompanying system card, OpenAI will soon publish additional thoughts on the social and economic implications of AI systems, including the need for effective regulation.

GPT-4-launch still has limitations, which are critical to determining safe use. exacerbate stereotyping or demeaning harms. For example, some versions of the model tended to hedge in response to questions about whether women should be allowed to vote. While our testing effort focused on harms of representation rather than allocative harms, it is important to note that the use of GPT-4 in contexts such as making decisions or informing decisions around allocation of opportunities or resources requires careful evaluation of performance across different groups. In particular, our usage policies prohibit the use of our models and products in the contexts of high risk government decision making (e.g, law enforcement, criminal justice, migration and asylum), or for offering legal or health advice. Additionally, GPT-4 exhibits some differences in performance for different demographics and tasks such as, for example, decreased performance for speakers of some languages, as discussed in the GPT-4 Technical Report. Differences such as these can also lead to disparities in quality of service. Some types of bias can be mitigated via training for refusals, i.e. by getting the model to refuse responding to certain questions. This can be effective when the prompt is a leading question attempting to generate content that explicitly stereotypes or demeans a group of people. However, it is important to note that refusals and other mitigations can also exacerbate[ 35] bias in some contexts, or can contribute to a false sense of assurance.[ 43] Additionally, unequal refusal behavior across different demographics or domains can lead to quality of service harms. For example, refusals can especially exacerbate issues of disparate performance by refusing to generate discriminatory content for one demographic group but complying for another.

To further our understanding of the impact of scale on few-shot learning, we trained a 540-billion parameter, densely activated, Transformer language model, which we call Pathways Language Model (PaLM). We trained PaLM on 6144 TPU v4 chips using Pathways, a new ML system which enables highly ecient training across multiple TPU Pods. We demonstrate continued benets of scaling by achieving state-ofthe-art few-shot learning results on hundreds of language understanding and generation benchmarks. On a number of these tasks, PaLM 540B achieves breakthrough performance, outperforming the netuned stateof-the-art on a suite of multi-step reasoning tasks, and outperforming average human performance on the recently released BIG-bench benchmark. A signicant number of BIG-bench tasks showed discontinuous improvements from model scale, meaning that performance steeply increased as we scaled to our largest model. PaLM also has strong capabilities in multilingual tasks and source code generation, which we demonstrate on a wide array of benchmarks. We additionally provide a comprehensive analysis on bias and toxicity, and study the extent of training data memorization with respect to model scale. Finally, we discuss the ethical considerations related to large language models and discuss potential mitigation strategies. ∗Equal Contribution.

Many of these models, such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and T5 (Rael et al., 2020), are trained with encoder-only or encoder-decoder architectures using an inlling (\masked LM" or \span corruption") pre-training objective on a large corpus of text, and are typically then adapted to one or more specic tasks through netuning. Although these models have achieved near universal state of the art across thousands of natural language tasks, the downside is that they require a signicant number of task-specic training examples to netune the model. Additionally, at least a portion of the model parameters must be updated to t the task, adding complexity from model netuning and deployment. GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) demonstrated that extremely large autoregressive language models (LMs) can be used for few-shot predictions, where the model is only given a natural language task description and (optionally) a handful of exemplars demonstrating how the task should be completed. This class of models is trained with a decoder-only architecture and a standard left-to-right language modeling objective on a large text corpus, where the objective is to predict the next token given the preceding tokens in the example. Few-shot evaluation has been shown to achieve very strong results without the need for large-scale task-specic data collection or model parameter updating. Since GPT-3, a number of other large autoregressive language models have been developed which have continued to push the state of the art forward. The most powerful of these post-GPT-3 models are GLaM (Du et al., 2021), Gopher (Rae et al., 2021), Chinchilla (Homann et al., 2022), Megatron{Turing NLG (Smith et al., 2022), and LaMDA (Thoppilan et al., 2022), all of which achieved few-shot state-of-the-art results on a signicant number of tasks at the time of their release.1Like GPT-3, these models are all variants of the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017). The improvements in these models have primarily come from one or more of the following approaches: (1) scaling the size of the models in both depth and width; (2) increasing the number of tokens that the model was trained on; (3) training on cleaner datasets from more diverse sources; and (4) increasing model capacity without increasing the computational cost through sparsely activated modules. In this work, we continue the scaling line of language modeling improvements and train a 540 billion parameter, densely activated, autoregressive Transformer on 780 billion tokens of high-quality text. This was achieved through the use of Pathways (Barham et al., 2022), a new ML system which enables highly ecient training of very large neural networks across thousands of accelerator chips, including those spanning multiple Tensor Processing Units (TPU) v4 Pods. This new model, called Pathways Language Model (PaLM), achieves state-of-the-art few-shot results across hundreds of natural language, code, and mathematical reasoning tasks. We achieve breakthrough performance on a number of these tasks. The key takeaways from this work are as follows: •Ecient scaling { We demonstrate the rst large-scale use of Pathways (Barham et al., 2022) { a new ML system which enables training a single model across thousands or tens of thousands of accelerator chips in a highly ecient manner. With Pathways, we trained a 540B parameter language model on 6144 TPU v4 chips at eciency levels that could not be reached before for models of this scale. Most previous large language models were either trained on a single TPU system (Du et al., 2021; Thoppilan et al., 2022) or used pipeline parallelism (Huang et al., 2019) to scale across GPU clusters (Smith et al., 2022) or multiple TPU v3 pods (Rae et al., 2021), with a maximum scale of 4096 TPU v3 chips. In Section 4, we describe how we were able to scale pipeline-free training of PaLM 540B to 6144 chips across two TPU v4 Pods while achieving very high eciency of 46.2% in model FLOPs utilization (observed throughput relative to theoretical max throughput) and 57.8% in hardware FLOPs utilization. •Continued improvements from scaling { In Section 6, we evaluate PaLM across hundreds of natural language, code, and mathematical reasoning tasks, and achieve state-of-the-art results on the 1We note that these models are all trained either on English data or diverse multilingual sets. Other models have achieved strong results targeting specic non-English languages, such as Zeng et al. (2021) for Chinese.

PaLM 2 Technical Report Google * Abstract We introduce PaLM 2, a new state-of-the-art language model that has better multilingual and reasoning capabilities and is more compute-efficient than its predecessor PaLM. PaLM 2 is a Transformer-based model trained using a mixture of objectives. Through extensive evaluations on English and multilingual language, and reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that PaLM 2 has significantly improved quality on downstream tasks across different model sizes, while simultaneously exhibiting faster and more efficient inference compared to PaLM. This improved efficiency enables broader deployment while also allowing the model to respond faster, for a more natural pace of interaction. PaLM 2 demonstrates robust reasoning capabilities exemplified by large improvements over PaLM on BIG-Bench and other reasoning tasks. PaLM 2 exhibits stable performance on a suite of responsible AI evaluations, and enables inference-time control over toxicity without additional overhead or impact on other capabilities. Overall, PaLM 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse set of tasks and capabilities. When discussing the PaLM 2 family, it is important to distinguish between pre-trained models (of various sizes), fine-tuned variants of these models, and the user-facing products that use these models. In particular, user-facing products typically include additional pre- and post-processing steps. Additionally, the underlying models may evolve over time. Therefore, one should not expect the performance of user-facing products to exactly match the results reported in this report. *See Section 7 for a list of authors.

Modeling began with n-gram based approaches (Kneser & Ney, 1995) but rapidly advanced with LSTMs (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997; Graves, 2014). Later work showed that language modelling also led to language understanding (Dai & Le, 2015). With increased scale and the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in language understanding and generation capabilities over the last few years, leading to breakthrough performance in reasoning, math, science, and language tasks (Howard & Ruder, 2018; Brown et al., 2020; Du et al., 2022; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021; Lewkowycz et al., 2022; Tay et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2023b). Key factors in these advances have been scaling up model size (Brown et al., 2020; Rae et al., 2021) and the amount of data (Hoffmann et al., 2022). To date, most LLMs follow a standard recipe of mostly monolingual corpora with a language modeling objective. We introduce PaLM 2, the successor to PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), a language model unifying modeling advances, data improvements, and scaling insights. PaLM 2 incorporates the following diverse set of research advances: •Compute-optimal scaling: Recently, compute-optimal scaling (Hoffmann et al., 2022) showed that data size is at least as important as model size. We validate this study for larger amounts of compute and similarly find that data and model size should be scaled roughly 1:1 to achieve the best performance for a given amount of training compute (as opposed to past trends, which scaled the model 3 ×faster than the dataset). •Improved dataset mixtures: Previous large pre-trained language models typically used a dataset dominated by English text (e.g., ∼78% of non-code in Chowdhery et al. (2022)). We designed a more multilingual and diverse pre-training mixture, which extends across hundreds of languages and domains (e.g., programming languages, mathematics, and parallel multilingual documents). We show that larger models can handle more disparate non-English datasets without causing a drop in English language understanding performance, and apply deduplication to reduce memorization (Lee et al., 2021) •Architectural and objective improvements: Our model architecture is based on the Transformer. Past LLMs have almost exclusively used a single causal or masked language modeling objective. Given the strong results of UL2 (Tay et al., 2023), we use a tuned mixture of different pre-training objectives in this model to train the model to understand different aspects of language. The largest model in the PaLM 2 family, PaLM 2-L, is significantly smaller than the largest PaLM model but uses more training compute. Our evaluation results show that PaLM 2 models significantly outperform PaLM on a variety of tasks, including natural language generation, translation, and reasoning. These results suggest that model scaling is not the only way to improve performance. Instead, performance can be unlocked by meticulous data selection and efficient architecture/objectives. Moreover, a smaller but higher quality model significantly improves inference efficiency, reduces serving cost, and enables the model’s downstream application for more applications and users. PaLM 2 demonstrates significant multilingual language, code generation and reasoning abilities, which we illustrate in Figures 2 and 3. More examples can be found in Appendix B.1PaLM 2 performs significantly better than PaLM on real-world advanced language proficiency exams and passes exams in all evaluated languages (see Figure 1). For some exams, this is a level of language proficiency sufficient to teach that language. In this report, generated samples and measured metrics are from the model itself without any external augmentations such as Google Search or Translate. PaLM 2 includes control tokens to enable inference-time control over toxicity, modifying only a fraction of pre-training as compared to prior work (Korbak et al., 2023). Special ‘canary’ token sequences were injected into PaLM 2 pretraining data to enable improved measures of memorization across languages (Carlini et al., 2019, 2021). We find that PaLM 2 has lower average rates of verbatim memorization than PaLM, and for tail languages we observe that memorization rates increase above English only when data is repeated several times across documents. We show that PaLM 2 has improved multilingual toxicity classification capabilities, and evaluate potential harms and biases across a range of potential downstream uses. We also include an analysis of the representation of people in pre-training data. These sections help downstream developers assess potential harms in their specific application contexts (Shelby et al., 2023), so that they can prioritize additional procedural and technical safeguards earlier in development. The rest of this report focuses on describing the considerations that went into designing PaLM 2 and evaluating its capabilities. 1Note that not all capabilities of PaLM 2 are currently exposed via PaLM 2 APIs.

Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models Gemini Team, Google1 This report introduces a new family of multimodal models, Gemini, that exhibit remarkable capabilities across image, audio, video, and text understanding. The Gemini family consists of Ultra, Pro, and Nano sizes, suitable for applications ranging from complex reasoning tasks to on-device memory-constrained use-cases. Evaluation on a broad range of benchmarks shows that our most-capable Gemini Ultra model advances the state of the art in 30 of 32 of these benchmarks — notably being the first model to achieve human-expert performance on the well-studied exam benchmark MMLU, and improving the state of the art in every one of the 20 multimodal benchmarks we examined. We believe that the new capabilities of the Gemini family in cross-modal reasoning and language understanding will enable a wide variety of use cases. We discuss our approach toward post-training and deploying Gemini models responsibly to users through services including Gemini, Gemini Advanced, Google AI Studio, and Cloud Vertex AI. 1. Introduction We present Gemini, a family of highly capable multimodal models developed at Google. We trained Gemini models jointly across image, audio, video, and text data for the purpose of building a model with both strong generalist capabilities across modalities alongside cutting-edge understanding and reasoning performance in each respective domain. Gemini1.0, ourfirstversion, comesinthreesizes: Ultraforhighly-complextasks, Proforenhanced performance and deployability at scale, and Nano for on-device applications. Each size is specifically tailored to address different computational limitations and application requirements. After large-scale pre-training, we post-train our models to improve overall quality, enhance target capabilities, and ensure alignment and safety criteria are met. Due to the varied requirements of our downstream applications, we have produced two post-trained Gemini model family variants. Chat-focused variants, referred to as Gemini Apps models, are optimized for Gemini and Gemini Advanced, our conversational AI service formerly known as Bard. Developer-focused variants, referred to as Gemini API models, are optimized for a range of products and are accessible through Google AI Studio and Cloud Vertex AI. We evaluate the performance of pre- and post-trained Gemini models on a comprehensive suite of internal and external benchmarks covering a wide range of language, coding, reasoning, and multimodal tasks. The Gemini family advances state-of-the-art in large-scale language modeling (Anil et al., 2023; Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2023; Hoffmann et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2023a; Radford et al., 2019; Rae et al., 2021), image understanding (Alayrac et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2022; Dosovitskiy et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b; Reed et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2022a), audio processing (Radford et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023), and video understanding (Alayrac et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023). It also builds on the work on sequence models (Sutskever et al., 2014), a long history of work in deep learning based on neural networks (LeCun et al., 2015), and machine learning distributed systems 1See Contributions and Acknowledgments section for full author list. Please send correspondence to gemini-1- report@google.com Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models (Barham et al., 2022; Bradbury et al., 2018; Dean et al., 2012) that enable large-scale training. Ourmostcapablemodel,GeminiUltra,achievesnewstate-of-the-artresultsin30of32benchmarks we report on, including 10 of 12 popular text and reasoning benchmarks, 9 of 9 image understanding benchmarks, 6 of 6 video understanding benchmarks, and 5 of 5 speech recognition and speech translation benchmarks. Gemini Ultra is the first model to achieve human-expert performance on MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021a) — a prominent benchmark testing knowledge and reasoning via a suite of exams — with a score above 90%. Beyond text, Gemini Ultra makes notable advances on challenging multimodal reasoning tasks. For example, on the recent MMMU benchmark (Yue et al., 2023), that comprises questions about images on multi-discipline tasks requiring college-level subject knowledge and deliberate reasoning, Gemini Ultra achieves a new state-of-the-art score of 62.4%, outperforming the previous best model by more than 5 percentage points. It provides a uniform performance lift for video question answering and audio understanding benchmarks. Qualitative evaluation showcases impressive crossmodal reasoning capabilities, enabling the model to understand and reason across an input sequence of audio, images, and text natively (see Figure 5 and Table 13). Consider the educational setting depicted in Figure 1 as an example. A teacher has drawna physics problem of a skier goingdowna slope, and astudent has workedthrough asolutionto it. Using Gemini models’ multimodal reasoning capabilities, the model is able to understand the messy handwriting, correctly understand the problem formulation, convert both the problem and solution to mathematical typesetting, identify the specific step of reasoning where the student went wrong in solving the problem, and then give a worked through correct solution to the problem. This opens up exciting educational possibilities, and we believe the new multimodal and reasoning capabilities of Gemini models have dramatic applications across many fields. The reasoning capabilities of large language models show promise toward building generalist agents that can tackle more complex multi-step problems. The AlphaCode team built AlphaCode 2 (Leblond et al, 2023), a new Gemini-model-powered agent, that combines Gemini models’ reasoning capabilities with search and tool-use to excel at solving competitive programming problems. AlphaCode 2 ranks within the top 15% of entrants on the Codeforces competitive programming platform, a large improvement over its state-of-the-art predecessor in the top 50% (Li et al., 2022). In tandem, we advance the frontier of efficiency with Gemini Nano, a series of small models targeting on-device deployment. These models excel in on-device tasks, such as summarization, reading comprehension, text completion tasks, and exhibit impressive capabilities in reasoning, STEM, coding, multimodal, and multilingual tasks relative to their sizes. In the following sections, we first provide an overview of the model architecture, training infrastructure, and pre-training dataset. We then present detailed evaluations of the pre- and post-trained Gemini model family, covering well-studied benchmarks across text, code, image, audio and video — which include both English performance and multilingual capabilities. Next we discuss our approach to post-training, highlight common and distinct aspects of the Gemini Apps and Gemini API model variants, and benchmark their performance on key capabilities. Responsible deployment is critical: we explain our process for impact assessments, developing model policies, evaluations, and mitigations of harm before deployment decisions. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of Gemini models, their limitations alongside their potential applications — paving the way for a new era of research and innovation in AI.

The model is able to correctly recognize all of the handwritten content and verify the reasoning. On top of understanding the text in the image, it needs to understand the problem setup and correctly follow instructions to generate L ATEX. 2. Model Architecture Gemini models build on top of Transformer decoders (Vaswani et al., 2017b) that are enhanced with improvements in architecture and model optimization to enable stable training at scale and optimized inference on Google’s Tensor Processing Units. They are trained to support 32k context length, employing efficient attention mechanisms (for e.g. multi-query attention (Shazeer, 2019a)). Our first version, Gemini 1.0, comprises three main sizes to support a wide range of applications as discussed in Table 1. Gemini models are trained to accommodate textual input interleaved with a wide variety of audio and visual inputs, such as natural images, charts, screenshots, PDFs, and videos, and they can produce text and image outputs (see Figure 2). The visual encoding of Gemini models is inspired by our own foundational work on Flamingo (Alayrac et al., 2022), CoCa (Yu et al., 2022a), and PaLI (Chen et al., 2022), with the important distinction that the models are multimodal from the beginning and can natively output images using discrete image tokens (Ramesh et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2022b). Video understanding is accomplished by encoding the video as a sequence of frames in the large context window. Video frames or images can be interleaved naturally with text or audio as part of the model input. The models can handle variable input resolution in order to spend more compute on tasks that require fine-grained understanding. In addition, Gemini models can directly ingest audio Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models Model size Model description Ultra Our most capable model that delivers state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of highly complex tasks, including reasoning and multimodal tasks. It is efficiently serveable at scale on TPU accelerators due to the Gemini architecture. Pro A performance-optimized model in terms of cost as well as latency that delivers significant performance across a wide range of tasks. This model exhibits strong reasoning performance and broad multimodal capabilities. Nano Our most efficient model, designed to run on-device. We trained two versions of Nano, with 1.8B (Nano-1) and 3.25B (Nano-2) parameters, targeting low and high memory devices respectively. It is trained by distilling from larger Gemini models. It is 4-bit quantized for deployment and provides best-in-class performance. Table 1|An overview of the Gemini 1.0 model family. Figure 2|Gemini models support interleaved sequences of text, image, audio, and video as inputs (illustrated by tokens of different colors in the input sequence). They can output responses with interleaved image and text. signals at 16kHz from Universal Speech Model (USM) (Zhang et al., 2023) features. This enables the model to capture nuances that are typically lost when the audio is naively mapped to a text input (for example, see audio understanding demo on the website). Training the Gemini family of models required innovations in training algorithms, dataset, and infrastructure. ForthePromodel, theinherentscalabilityofourinfrastructureandlearningalgorithms enable us to complete pre-training in a matter of weeks, leveraging a fraction of the Ultra’s resources. The Nano series of models leverage additional advancements in distillation and training algorithms to produce the best-in-class small language models for a wide variety of tasks, such as summarization and reading comprehension, which power our next generation on-device experiences. 3. Training Infrastructure We trained Gemini models using TPUv5e and TPUv4 (Jouppi et al., 2023), depending on their sizes and configuration. Training Gemini Ultra used a large fleet of TPUv4 accelerators owned by Google Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models across multiple datacenters. This represents a significant increase in scale over our prior flagship model PaLM-2 which presented new infrastructure challenges. Scaling up the number of accelerators results in a proportionate decrease in the mean time between failure of hardware in the overall system. We minimized the rate of planned reschedules and preemptions, but genuine machine failures are commonplace across all hardware accelerators at such large scales. TPUv4 accelerators are deployed in “SuperPods” of 4096 chips, each connected to a dedicated optical switch, which can dynamically reconfigure 4x4x4 chip cubes into arbitrary 3D torus topologies in around 10 seconds (Jouppi et al., 2023). For Gemini Ultra, we decided to retain a small number of cubes per superpod to allow for hot standbys and rolling maintenance. TPU accelerators primarily communicate over the high speed inter-chip-interconnect, but at Gemini Ultra scale, we combine SuperPods in multiple datacenters using Google’s intra-cluster and inter-cluster network (Poutievski et al., 2022; Wetherall et al., 2023; yao Hong et al., 2018). Google’s network latencies and bandwidths are sufficient to support the commonly used synchronous training paradigm, exploiting model parallelism within superpods and data-parallelism across superpods. The ‘single controller’ programming model of Jax (Bradbury et al., 2018) and Pathways (Barham et al., 2022) allows a single Python process to orchestrate the entire training run, dramatically simplifying the development workflow. The GSPMD partitioner (Xu et al., 2021) in the XLA compiler partitions the training step computation, and the MegaScale XLA compiler (XLA, 2019) pass statically schedules appropriate collectives so that they maximally overlap with the computation with very little variation in step time. Maintaining a high goodput2at this scale would have been impossible using the conventional approach of periodic checkpointing of weights to persistent cluster storage. For Gemini models, we instead made use of redundant in-memory copies of the model state, and on any unplanned hardware failures, we rapidly recover directly from an intact model replica. Compared to both PaLM and PaLM-2 (Anil et al., 2023), this provided a substantial speedup in recovery time, despite the significantly larger training resources being used. As a result, the overall goodput for the largest-scale training job increased from 85% to 97%. Training at unprecedented scale invariably surfaces new and interesting systems failure modes - and in this instance one of the problems that we needed to address was that of “Silent Data Corruption (SDC)” (Dixit et al., 2021; Hochschild et al., 2021; Vishwanathan et al., 2015). Although these are extremely rare, the scale of Gemini models means that we can expect SDC events to impact training every week or two. Rapidly detecting and removing faulty hardware required several new techniques that exploit deterministic replay to isolate incorrect computations, combined with proactive SDC scanners on idle machines and hot standbys. Our fully deterministic infrastructure allowed us to quickly identify root causes (including hardware failures) during the development leading up to the Ultra model, and this was a crucial ingredient towards stable training. 4. Pre-Training Dataset Gemini models are trained on a dataset that is both multimodal and multilingual. Our pre-training dataset uses data from web documents, books, and code, and includes image, audio, and video data. We use the SentencePiece tokenizer (Kudo and Richardson, 2018) and find that training the tokenizer on a large sample of the entire training corpus improves the inferred vocabulary and subsequently improves model performance. For example, we find Gemini models can efficiently 2We define goodput as the time spent computing useful new steps over the elapsed time of the training job. Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models tokenize non-Latin scripts which can, in turn, benefit model quality as well as training and inference speed. The number of tokens used to train the largest models were determined following the approach in Hoffmann et al. (2022). The smaller models are trained for significantly more tokens to improve performance for a given inference budget, similar to the approach advocated in Touvron et al. (2023a). We apply quality filters to all datasets, using both heuristic rules and model-based classifiers. We also perform safety filtering to remove harmful content based on our policies. To maintain the integrity of evaluations, we search for and remove any evaluation data that may have been in our training corpus before using data for training. The final data mixtures and weights were determined through ablations on smaller models. We stage training to alter the mixture composition during training – increasing the weight of domain-relevant data towards the end of training. We find that data quality is an important factor for highly-performing models, and believe that many interesting questions remain around finding the optimal dataset distribution for pre-training. 5. Evaluation The Gemini models are natively multimodal, as they are trained jointly across text, image, audio, and video. One open question is whether this joint training can result in a model which has strong capabilities in each domain – even when compared to models and approaches that are narrowly tailored to single domains. We find this to be the case: Gemini models set a new state of the art across a wide range of text, image, audio, and video benchmarks. ww 5.1. Text 5.1.1. Academic Benchmarks We compare pre- and post-trained Gemini Pro and Ultra models to a suite of external LLMs and our previous best model PaLM 2 across a series of text-based academic benchmarks covering reasoning, reading comprehension, STEM, and coding. We report these results in Table 2. Broadly, we find that the performance of Gemini Pro outperforms inference-optimized models such as GPT-3.5 and performs comparably with several of the most capable models available, and Gemini Ultra outperforms all current models. In this section, we examine some of these findings. On MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021a), Gemini Ultra can outperform all existing models, achieving an accuracy of 90.04%. MMLU is a holistic exam benchmark, which measures knowledge across a set of 57 subjects. Human expert performance is gauged at 89.8% by the benchmark authors, and Gemini Ultra is the first model to exceed this threshold, with the prior state-of-the-art result at 86.4%. Achieving high performance requires specialist knowledge across many domains (e.g. law, biology, history, etc.), alongside reading comprehension and reasoning. We find Gemini Ultra achieves highest accuracy when used in combination with a chain-of-thought prompting approach (Wei et al., 2022b) that accounts for model uncertainty. The model produces a chain of thought with k samples, for example 8 or 32. If there is a consensus above a preset threshold (selected based on the validation split), it selects this answer, otherwise it reverts to a greedy sample based on maximum likelihood choice without chain of thought. We refer the reader to appendix for a detailed breakdown of how this approach compares with only chain-of-thought prompting or only greedy sampling. In mathematics, a field commonly used to benchmark the analytical capabilities of models, Gemini Ultra shows strong performance on both elementary exams and competition-grade problem sets. For the grade-school math benchmark, GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), we find Gemini Ultra reaches 94.4% Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models accuracy with chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency (Wang et al., 2022) compared to the previous best accuracy of 92% with the same prompting technique. Similar positive trends are observedinincreaseddifficultymathproblemsdrawnfrommiddle-andhigh-schoolmathcompetitions (MATH benchmark), with the Gemini Ultra model outperforming all competitor models, reaching 53.2% using 4-shot prompting. The model also outperforms the state of the art on even harder tasks derived from American Mathematical Competitions (150 questions from 2022 and 2023). Smaller models perform poorly on this challenging task scoring close to random, but Gemini Ultra can solve 32% of the questions, compared to the 30% solve rate for GPT-4. Gemini Ultra also excels in coding, a popular use case of current LLMs. We evaluate the model on many conventional and internal benchmarks and also measure its performance as part of more complex reasoning systems such as AlphaCode 2 (see Section 5.1.7 on complex reasoning systems). For example, on HumanEval, a standard code-completion benchmark (Chen et al., 2021) mapping functiondescriptionstoPythonimplementations, instruction-tunedGeminiUltracorrectlyimplements 74.4% of problems. On a new held-out evaluation benchmark for python code generation tasks, Natural2Code, where we ensure no web leakage, Gemini Ultra achieves the highest score of 74.9%. Evaluation on these benchmarks is challenging and may be affected by data contamination. We performed an extensive leaked data analysis after training to ensure the results we report here are as scientifically sound as possible, but still found some minor issues and decided not to report results on e.g. LAMBADA (Paperno et al., 2016). As part of the evaluation process, on a popular benchmark, HellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019), we find that an additional hundred fine-tuning steps on specific website extracts corresponding to the HellaSwag training set (which were not included in the Gemini model pretraining set) improve the validation accuracy of Gemini Pro to 89.6% and Gemini Ultra to 96.0%, when measured with 1-shot prompting (we measured GPT-4 obtained 92.3% when evaluated 1-shot via the API). This suggests that the benchmark results are susceptible to the pretraining dataset composition. We choose to report HellaSwag decontaminated results only in a 10-shot evaluation setting. We believe there is a need for more robust and nuanced standardized evaluation benchmarks with no leaked data. So, we evaluate Gemini models on several new held-out evaluation datasets that were recently released, such as WMT23 and Math-AMC 2022-2023 problems, or internally generated from non-web sources, such as Natural2Code. We refer the reader to Appendix 10.3 for a comprehensive list of our evaluation benchmarks. Even so, model performance on these benchmarks gives us an indication of the model capabilities and where they may provide impact on real-world tasks. For example, Gemini Ultra’s impressive reasoning and STEM competencies pave the way for advancements in LLMs within the educational domain3. The ability to tackle complex mathematical and scientific concepts opens up exciting possibilities for personalized learning and intelligent tutoring systems. 5.1.2. Trends in Capabilities We investigate the trends in capabilities across the Gemini model family by evaluating them on a holistic harness of more than 50 benchmarks in six different capabilities, noting that some of the most notable benchmarks were discussed in the last section. These capabilities are: “Factuality” covering open/closed-book retrieval and question answering tasks; “Long-Context” covering longform summarization, retrieval and question answering tasks; “Math/Science” including tasks for mathematical problem solving, theorem proving, and scientific exams; “Reasoning” tasks that require arithmetic,scientific,andcommonsensereasoning;“Multilingual”tasksfortranslation,summarization, and reasoning in multiple languages.

Multilinguality The multilingual capabilities of the Gemini models are evaluated using a diverse set of tasks requiring multilingual understanding, cross-lingual generalization, and the generation of text in multiple languages. These tasks include machine translation benchmarks (WMT 23 for high-medium-low resource translation; Flores, NTREX for low and very low resource languages), summarization benchmarks (XLSum, Wikilingua), and translated versions of common benchmarks (MGSM: professionally translated into 11 languages). 5.1.4.1 Machine Translation Translation is a canonical benchmark in machine learning with a rich history. We evaluated a posttrained Gemini API Ultra model (see Section 6.5.3) on the entire set of language pairs in the WMT 23 translation benchmark in a few-shot setting. Overall, we found that Gemini Ultra (and other Gemini models) performed remarkably well at translating from English to any other language, and surpassed Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models the LLM-based translation methods when translating out-of-English, on high-resource, mid-resource and low-resource languages. In the WMT 23 out-of-English translation tasks, Gemini Ultra achieved the highest LLM-based translation quality, with an average BLEURT (Sellam et al., 2020) score of 74.8, compared to GPT-4’s score of 73.6, and PaLM 2’s score of 72.2. When averaged across all language pairs and directions for WMT 23, we see a similar trend with Gemini Ultra 74.4, GPT-4 73.8 and PaLM 2-L 72.7 average BLEURT scores on this benchmark.

These languages were sampled from the tail of the following language sets: Flores-200 (Tamazight and Kanure), NTREX (North Ndebele), and an internal benchmark (Quechua). For these languages, both from and into English, Gemini Ultra achieved an average chrF score of 27.0 in 1-shot setup, while the next-best model, PaLM 2-L, achieved a score of 25.3. 5.1.4.2 Multilingual Math and Summarization Beyond translation, we evaluated how well Gemini models perform in challenging tasks across a range of languages. We specifically investigated the math benchmark MGSM (Shi et al., 2023), which is a translated variant of the math benchmark GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). We find Gemini Ultra achieves an accuracy of 79.0%, an advance over PaLM 2-L which scores 74.7%, when averaged across all languages in an 8-shot setup. We also benchmark Gemini models on the multilingual summarization benchmarks – XLSum (Hasan et al., 2021) and WikiLingua (Ladhak et al., 2020). In XLSum, Gemini Ultra reached an average of 17.6 rougeL score compared to 15.4 for PaLM 2. For Wikilingua, Gemini Ultra (5-shot) trails behind PaLM 2 (3-shot) measured in BLEURT score. See

Gemini 1.5: Unlocking multimodal understanding across millions of tokens of context Gemini Team, Google1 In this report, we introduce the Gemini 1.5 family of models, representing the next generation of highly compute-efficient multimodal models capable of recalling and reasoning over fine-grained information from millions of tokens of context, including multiple long documents and hours of video and audio. The family includes two new models: (1) an updated Gemini 1.5 Pro, which exceeds the February version on the great majority of capabilities and benchmarks; (2) Gemini 1.5 Flash, a more lightweight variant designed for efficiency with minimal regression in quality. Gemini 1.5 models achieve near-perfect recall on long-context retrieval tasks across modalities, improve the state-of-the-art in long-document QA, long-video QA and long-context ASR, and match or surpass Gemini 1.0 Ultra’s state-of-the-art performance across a broad set of benchmarks. Studying the limits of Gemini 1.5’s long-context ability, we find continued improvement in next-token prediction and near-perfect retrieval (>99%) up to at least 10M tokens, a generational leap over existing models such as Claude 3.0 (200k) and GPT-4 Turbo (128k). Finally, we highlight real-world use cases, such as Gemini 1.5 collaborating with professionals on completing their tasks achieving 26 to 75% time savings across 10 different job categories, as well as surprising new capabilities of large language models at the frontier; when given a grammar manual for Kalamang, a language with fewer than 200 speakers worldwide, the model learns to translate English to Kalamang at a similar level to a person who learned from the same content. 1. Introduction We present our latest multimodal models from the Gemini line: Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash. They are members of Gemini 1.5, a new family of highly-capable multimodal models which incorporates our latest innovations in sparse and dense scaling as well as major advances in training, distillation and serving infrastructure that allow it to push the boundary of efficiency, reasoning, planning, multi-linguality, function calling and long-context performance. Gemini 1.5 models are built to handle extremely long contexts; they have the ability to recall and reason over fine-grained information from up to at least 10M tokens. This scale is unprecedented among contemporary large language models (LLMs), and enables the processing of long-form mixed-modality inputs including entire collections of documents, multiple hours of video, and almost five days long of audio. TheGemini1.5PropresentedinthisreportisanupdateoverthepreviousGemini1.5ProFebruary version and it outperforms it predecessor on most capabilities and benchmarks. All in all, the Gemini 1.5 series represents a generational leap in model performance and training efficiency. Gemini 1.5 Pro surpasses Gemini 1.0 Pro and 1.0 Ultra on a wide array of benchmarks while requiring significantly less compute to train. Similarly, Gemini 1.5 Flash performs uniformly better compared to 1.0 Pro and even performs at a similar level to 1.0 Ultra on several benchmarks. The ability to model data of increasingly longer contexts has tracked the development of more generalandcapablelanguagemodels, fromthenowtoy2-gramlanguagemodelproposedbyShannon 1Please send correspondence to gemini-1_5-report@google.com. Gemini 1.5: Unlocking multimodal understanding across millions of tokens of context Figure 1|Gemini 1.5 Proachievesnear-perfect “needle” recall (>99.7%) up to1M tokens of “haystack” in all modalities, i.e., text, video and audio. It even maintains this recall performance when extending to 10M tokens in the text modality (approximately 7M words); 9.7M tokens in the audio modality (up to 107 hours); 9.9M tokens in the video modality (up to 10.5 hours). The x-axis represents the context window, and the y-axis the depth percentage of the needle placed for a given context length. The results are color-coded to indicate: green for successful retrievals and red for unsuccessful ones. Note that the performance for all modalities is obtained with the previously reported Gemini 1.5 Pro version from February. (1948), to the modern n-gram models of the 1990s & 2000s typically constrained to 5 tokens of context (Brants et al., 2007; Chen and Goodman, 1999; Jelinek, 1998; Kneser and Ney, 1995), to recurrent neural networks language models from the 2010s which could effectively condition on hundredsoftokens(Jozefowiczetal.,2016;Mikolovetal.,2010),tothemodernTransformer(Vaswani et al., 2017) which can condition on hundreds of thousands of tokens (Anthropic, 2023a). Gemini 1.5 Pro continues this trend by extending language model context lengths by over an order of magnitude. Scaling to millions of tokens, we find a continued improvement in predictive performance (Section5.2.1.1), nearperfectrecall(>99%)onsyntheticretrievaltasks(Figure1andSection5.2.1.2), and a host of surprising new capabilities like in-context learning from entire long documents and multimodal content (Section 5.2.2). To measure the effectiveness of our models’ multimodal long-context capabilities, we conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world tasks. In synthetic “needle-in-a-haystack” tasks inspired by Kamradt (2023) that probe how reliably the model can recall information amidst distractor context, we find that both Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash achieve near-perfect (>99%) “needle” recall up to multiple millions of tokens of “haystack” in all modalities, i.e., text, video and audio. As part of our experimental setup, we also assessed the performance of Gemini 1.5 Pro when extending Gemini 1.5: Unlocking multimodal understanding across millions of tokens of context the context to 10M tokens across all three modalities. We found that the recall performance was maintained even with this significant increase in context size.

Detailed results are presented in Table 10.∗In speech recognition, it is generally accepted that any difference in Word Error Rate (WER) that falls within a 3% relative range is not statistically significant and can be considered as mere noise, and we grouped such instances as wins for the latest systems.

Gemini 1.5 Flash while being smaller and way more efficient and faster to serve, maintains high levels of performance even as its context window increases. Detailed results are presented in Table 10. In more realistic multimodal long-context benchmarks which require retrieval andreasoning over multiple parts of the context (such as answering questions from long documents or long videos), we also see Gemini 1.5 Pro outperforming all competing models across all modalities even when these models are augmented with external retrieval methods. We showcase the in-context learning abilities of both Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash enabled by very long context: for example, learning to translate a new language from a single set of linguistic documentation. With only instructional materials (a 500-page reference grammar, a dictionary, and ≈400extra parallel sentences) all provided in context, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash are capable of learning to translate from Gemini 1.5: Unlocking multimodal understanding across millions of tokens of context English to Kalamang— a Papuan language with fewer than 200 speakers2and therefore almost no online presence—with quality similar to a person who learned from the same materials. Moreover, we add in 45 minutes of transcribed Kalamang speech recordings to demonstrate that Gemini 1.5, for the first time with an LLM, can leverage mixed-modal documentation to learn speech recognition for a new language in context. We further showcase how long-context capability of Gemini 1.5 models break grounds on long-context automatic speech recognition, long-context video understanding, in-context planning and unstructured multimodal data analytics tasks. Importantly, this leap in long-context performance does not come at the expense of the core multimodal capabilities of the model.3Across a extensive battery of evaluations, both Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash greatly surpass Gemini 1.0 Pro (44/50 for Gemini 1.5 Pro and 41/50 for Gemini 1.5 Flash). These include core capabilities such as Math, Science and Reasoning (+49.6% and +30.8%, respectively, Sec. 6.1.1), Multilinguality (+21.4% and +16.7%, Sec. 6.1.4), Video Understanding (+18.7% and +7.5%, Sec. 6.2.4), Natural Image Understanding (+21.7% and +18.9%, Sec. 6.2.3), Chart and Document Understanding (+63.9% and +35.9%, Sec. 6.2.2), Multimodal Reasoning (+31.5% and +15.6%, Sec. 6.2.1), Code (+21.5% and +10.3%, Sec. 6.1.3), and more (see Table 10 and Table 2 for full breakdowns). These evaluations additionally evaluate on a series of “agentic” tasks including Function Calling (+72.8% and +54.6%, Sec. 6.1.5), planning (Sec. 5.2.2.7) and in-the-wild long-tail real world use cases such as improving job productivity for professionals (Sec. 6.1.7). These advances are particularly striking when benchmarking against Gemini 1.0 Ultra, a state-of-the-art model across many capabilities. Despite using significantly less training compute and being more efficient to serve, Gemini 1.5 Pro performs better on more than half of the overall benchmarks (35/45), and the majority of vision (18/21) and text (16/19) benchmarks. For Gemini 1.5 Flash, which substantially more efficient to serve and faster at inference time, we find it to be be better than Ultra 1.0 on the majority of vision benchmarks (13/21) and almost half the text benchmarks (8/18). In the following sections, we provide an overview of the model architecture and present the results of large-scale quantitative evaluations comparing Gemini 1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash to other LLMs. We present detailed evaluations for the models’ long context capabilities followed by evaluations of their core capabilities, similar to the Gemini 1.0 Technical Report (Gemini-Team et al., 2023), covering well-studied benchmarks across text, code, image, video and audio. Finally, we discuss our approach to responsible deployment, including our process for impact assessment developing model policies, evaluations, and mitigations of harm before deployment decisions.4 2. An Improved Gemini 1.5 Pro Since the initial release in February, Gemini 1.5 Pro has undergone a number of pre-training and post-training iterations. These iterations have led to significant improvement in performance across the spectrum of model capabilities. On average, we see more than 10% relative improvement in evals over the previous version of 1.5 Pro. See Figure 2 for a highlight of performance across a selection of bencharks. On reasoning benchmarks, 1.5 Pro’s performance on MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021b) has improved from 58.5% to 67.7% while on GPQA (Rein et al., 2023) 1.5 Pro now scores 46.2% compared to 41.5% before. We see a similar picture on multimodal tasks, with 1.5 Pro improving on all image understanding benchmarks and most video understanding benchmarks; on MathVista (Lu et al., 2023) Gemini 1.5 Pro’s performance improves from 52.1% to 63.9%, on InfographicVQA (Mathew et al., 2022) it 3We define the core capabilities as those capabilities of the model that are primarily non long-context (e.g., math, science, reasoning, code) similar to capabilities covered in the Gemini 1.0 Technical Report(Gemini-Team et al., 2023). 4See the model card (Mitchell et al., 2019a) in Appendix Section 12.1.

Gemini 1.5 Pro Gemini 1.5 Pro is a sparse mixture-of-expert (MoE) Transformer-based model that builds on Gemini 1.0’s (Gemini-Team et al., 2023) research advances and multimodal capabilities. Gemini 1.5 Pro also builds on a much longer history of MoE research at Google (Clark et al., 2022; Du et al., 2022; Fedus et al., 2021; Lepikhin et al., 2020; Riquelme et al., 2021; Shazeer et al., 2017; Zoph et al., 2022) and language model research in the broader literature (Anil et al., 2023b; Anthropic, 2023a; Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2023b; Hoffmann et al., 2022; Jiang et al., 2024; Kim et al., 2021; OpenAI, 2023a; Rae et al., 2021; Raffel et al., 2020; Roller et al., 2021; Thoppilan et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023a,b; Vaswani et al., 2017). MoE models use a learned routing function to direct inputs to a subset of the model’s parameters for processing. This form of conditional computation (Bengio et al., 2013; Davis and Arel, 2014; Jacobs et al., 1991) allows models to grow their total parameter count while keeping the number of parameters that are activated for any given input constant. Ahostofimprovementsmadeacrossnearlytheentiremodelstack(architecture,data,optimization and systems) allows Gemini 1.5 Pro to achieve comparable quality to Gemini 1.0 Ultra (see Section 6), while using significantly less training compute and being significantly more efficient to serve. Gemini 1.5 Pro also incorporates a series of significant architecture changes that enable long-context understanding of inputs up to 10 million tokens without degrading performance. Translated into real Gemini 1.5: Unlocking multimodal understanding across millions of tokens of context world data, this context length enables Gemini 1.5 Pro models to comfortably process almost five days of audio recordings (i.e., 107 hours), more than ten times the entirety of the 1440 page book (or 587,287 words) "War and Peace", the entire Flax (Heek et al., 2023) codebase (41,070 lines of code), or 10.5 hours of video at 1 frame-per-second. Further, since the model is natively multimodal and supports interleaving of data from different modalities, it can support a mix of audio, visual, text, and code inputs in the same input sequence. In Section 5.1, we highlight some of the novel capabilities enabled by these advances, including evaluations that yielded positive results on context lengths up to 10 million. We note that understanding the limits of these capabilities and studying their exciting capabilities and applications remains an area of continued research exploration. 3.2. Gemini 1.5 Flash Gemini 1.5 Flash is a transformer decoder model with the same 2M+ context and multimodal capabilities as Gemini 1.5 Pro, designed for efficient utilization of tensor processing units (TPUs) with lower latency for model serving. For example, Gemini 1.5 Flash does parallel computation of attention and feedforward components (Chowdhery et al., 2023b), and is also online distilled (Agarwal et al., 2024b; Anil et al., 2018; Beyer et al., 2021; Bucila et al., 2006; Hinton et al., 2015) from the much larger Gemini 1.5 Pro model. It is trained with higher-order preconditioned methods (Becker and LeCun, 1989; Duchi et al., 2011; Heskes, 2000) for improved quality. 3.3. Serving efficiency and latency In addition to serving 2M+ context, Gemini 1.5 models were designed for high efficiency and low latency at all context lengths. For most queries, the time per output character dominates total request latency during transformer inference (Pope et al., 2023), and this compounds for applications using chained prompts and agentic workflows. To assess the latency of Gemini 1.5 compared with other foundation model APIs across multiple languages, we report the average time per output character on English, Japanese, Chinese, and French queries. Latency measurements were taken from the Vertex AI streaming API for Gemini 1.5 and Claude 3, and from the OpenAI streaming API for GPT 3.5 and GPT 4. To account for variance in traffic load, we calculate the mean time per output character for 32 queries and report the minimum value across the 32 requests.

Across all four evaluated languages, Gemini 1.5 Flash yields the fastest output generation of all models, and Gemini 1.5 Pro shows faster generation than GPT-4 Turbo, Claude 3 Sonnet, and Claude 3 Opus (see Table 3). For English queries, Gemini 1.5 Flash generates over 650 characters per second, more than 30% faster than Claude 3 Haiku, the second fastest of the models evaluated. Gemini 1.5: Unlocking multimodal understanding across millions of tokens of context 4. Training Infrastructure and Dataset Like Gemini 1.0 series, Gemini 1.5 models are trained on multiple 4096-chip pods of Google’s TPUv4 accelerators, distributed across multiple datacenters, and on a variety of multimodal and multilingual data. Our pre-training dataset includes data sourced across many different domains, including web documents and code, and incorporates image, audio, and video content. For the instructiontuning phase we finetuned Gemini 1.5 models on a collection of multimodal data (containing paired instructions and appropriate responses), with further tuning based on human preference data. We refer readers to the Gemini 1.0 Technical Report (Gemini-Team et al., 2023) for further information. 5. Evaluation Results Existing evaluations are increasingly strained by the new and rapidly advancing capabilities of large multimodal models. They typically focus on individual modalities and/or are restricted to tasks with shorter context lengths. Hence, there is a growing need for benchmarks which exemplify the nuanced requirements of real world long mixed-modality use cases. Among these, we highlight the quantitative assessment of reasoning capabilities across long mixed-modality sequences as a key challenge. With the challenges of evaluating increasingly capable models in mind, our evaluation of Gemini 1.5seriesfirstfocusesonunderstandingandevaluatingitsnovelcapabilities. Subsequently, weexplore core benchmarks, covering capabilities studied in the Gemini 1.0 Technical Report (Gemini-Team et al., 2023). Specifically, we evaluate Gemini 1.5 in three main categories:5 1.Qualitative long-context multimodal evaluations: manually probe and stress-test the model’s long-context abilities, especially for novel capabilities where no quantitative benchmarks exist. 2.Quantitative long-context multimodal evaluations: measure the model’s long-context abilities on both synthetic and real-world tasks with well-defined metrics. 3.Quantitative core evaluations: identify progress and regression in core capabilities (e.g., coding, math, science, multilinguality and instruction following). 5.1. Qualitative Examples of Multimodal Long-Context Capabilities The ability to process multiple millions of tokens unlocks practical applications that were not possible before. In this section we demonstrate some surprising interactions we observed with Gemini 1.5 Pro across code, text and video.6 As shown in the Figure 3, Gemini 1.5 Pro is able to ingest entire large codebases such as JAX (746,152 tokens), and answer very specific queries about them. in Figure 4 we show Gemini 1.5 Pro’s ability to learn a new language based only on reference materials given in its input (see Section 5.2.2.1 for quantitative metrics for this use case). Additionally, we test Gemini 1.5 Pro’s ability to answer an image query given the entire text of Les Misérables and observe that being natively multimodal allows it to locate a famous scene from a hand-drawn sketch, as shown in Figure 5. Lastly, we ask Gemini 1.5 Pro questions about an entire movie of 45 minutes in Figure 6 which the model answers seamlessly while retrieving moments and timestamps down to a second. 5We note that all the evaluations are from the same checkpoint of the Gemini 1.5 models that are instruction tuned post pre-training, unless otherwise stated. All sampling evals throughout the report are done with temperature 0 (greedy decoding). 6For additional short videos of demonstrations of the long context abilities of Gemini 1.5 Pro across video, text, and Gemini 1.5: Unlocking multimodal understanding across millions of tokens of context Figure 3|Given the entire 746,152 token JAX codebase in context, Gemini 1.5 Pro can identify the specific location of a core automatic differentiation method.

Long-context Evaluations Forthepastfewyears, LLMresearchhasprioritizedexpandingthecontextwindowfromwhichmodels can incorporate information (Anthropic, 2023a; OpenAI, 2023a). This emphasis stems from the recognition that a wider context window allows models to incorporate a larger amount of new, taskspecific information not found in the training data at inference time, leading to improved performance in various natural language or multimodal tasks. Recent approaches to improving the long-context capabilities of models fall into a few categories, including novel architectural approaches (Ainslie et al., 2023; Gu and Dao, 2023; Guo et al., 2021; Orvieto et al., 2023; Zaheer et al., 2020), posttraining modifications (Bertsch et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b; Press et al., 2021; Xiong et al., 2023), retrieval-augmented models (Guu et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022; Jiang et al., 2022; Karpukhin et al., 2020; Santhanam et al., 2021), memory-augmented models (Bulatov et al., 2022, 2023; Martins et al., 2022; Mu et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022a,b; Zhong et al., 2022), and techniques for building more coherent long-context datasets (Shi et al., 2023b; Staniszewski et al., 2023). This activity has resulted in measurable improvements on long-context capabilities of LLMs over the past several months, with the recent concurrent work of Liu et al. (2024) exploring context window of 7B models up to 1M multimodal tokens. Notably, among the state-of-the-art LLMs, Anthropic has successfully extended the context of their text-only Claude 2 model to 100k tokens, while OpenAI has recently Gemini 1.5: Unlocking multimodal understanding across millions of tokens of context 128 256 512 1K 2K 4K 8K16K 32K 64K128K 256K 512K 1M1M Sequence positionNegative Log-Likelihood Cumulative Average NLL for Long Documents.

A lower value demonstrates better prediction. Gemini 1.5 Pro shows improved predictions up to 1M tokens for long-documents and 10M tokens for code, whereas Gemini 1.0 Pro improves up to only 32K tokens. Gemini 1.5 Flash shows improvement up to 1M tokens for long-documents and 2M tokens in code. The NLL of Gemini 1.5 Pro follows a power-law trend up until 1M tokens (documents) and 2M tokens (code) with a deviating trend at 10M tokens. released GPT-4 Turbo reaching 128k tokens. Finally, the latest addition to the series was Claude 3 with a context window of up to 1M tokens. Gemini 1.5 Pro significantly extend this context length frontier to multiple millions of tokens with almost no degradation in performance, making it possible to process significantly larger inputs. Compared to Claude 2.1 with a 200k token context window, Gemini 1.5 Pro achieves a 100% recall at 200k tokens, surpassing Claude 2.1’s 98%. This 100% recall is maintained up to 530k tokens, and recall is 99.7% at 1M tokens. When increasing from 1M tokens to 10M tokens, the model retains 99.2% recall. Moreover, Gemini 1.5 Pro’s native multimodal capabilities enables the model to ingest multiple hours of audio and video recordings alongside or interleaved with text. Such recall capabilities are summarized in Figure 1. Below we report results on long-context evaluations across all three modalities, i.e., text, vision and audio. Similarly, Gemini 1.5 Flash achieves almost perfect recall across all three modalities up to 2M tokens, yielding 100% recall on text, 99.8% on video and 99.1% on audio. The evaluation methodology we followed to measure the long-context capability of Gemini 1.5 models consists of both diagnostic-focused probing of the long context capabilities (e.g., perplexity over long sequences, needle-in-a-haystack retrieval studies) and realistic evaluations specifically designed for multimodal long-context tasks (e.g., long-document QA, long-context automatic speech recognition, learning to translate a new language from only one book, and long-context video QA). To provide a reference point, throughout this section we compare Gemini 1.5 models with the leading model available externally for each task. With the evaluation harness we developed for Gemini 1.5 models we are able to quantify the quality of long-context understanding capabilities reliably all the way up to 10M tokens. 5.2.1. Diagnostic Long-Context Evaluations 5.2.1.1 Perplexity over Long Sequences We start by reporting results on the text modality. To evaluate the ability of the models to make use of very long contexts to improve next-token prediction, which is the objective function used to train language models, we record the negative log-likelihood (NLL) of tokens at different positions in Gemini 1.5: Unlocking multimodal understanding across millions of tokens of context the input sequences from held-out text (i.e., not used in training). Here, a lower value implies an improved prediction. Typically, we expect tokens at the beginning of a sequence to have high NLL, as there is little to no context that the model can use to predict them, and tokens later in the sequence to have lower NLL as more information becomes available to the model. The shape of the resulting curve indicates the abilities of models to reason over long-context. A downward trend signifies models making use of long-context to reduce models’ uncertainty. On the other hand, an upward trend signifies that models are unable to effectively use information from the previous context and may be deteriorating in prediction quality, highlighting the limitations in their long-context understanding capability. We perform this analysis on two data sources: (a) a dataset of long documents with up to 1 million tokens, and (b) a dataset of code repositories constructed by first randomly shuffling all the files and then concatenating them. The code dataset contains sequences longer than 1 million tokens with some natural form of semantic association (e.g., a whole repository), allowing for further evaluation of sequences of up to 10M tokens. Figure 7 shows the cumulative NLL up to a specific token index.7 We also fit a power law of the form L(x)=αxβ+γto these data points (dashed line). We find in Figure 7 that NLL decreases monotonically with sequence length and thus prediction accuracy improves up to the tested sequence lengths (1M for long documents, and 10M for code), indicating that our models can make use of the whole input even at very long-context lengths. This suggests that Gemini 1.5 models are able to improve their predictions by finding useful patterns in tokens, even if they occurred millions of tokens in the past, as in the case of code. Finally, we see this improved prediction follows a regular power-law structure. While it is well known that language models follow a power-law in terms of training compute to model performance (NLL) (Kaplan et al., 2020) up to a very large scale, we demonstrate that a power law can hold between log-loss and context length up to extremely long context lengths. We see the power-law fit is quite accurate up to 1M tokens for long-documents and about 2M tokens for code for Gemini 1.5 Pro. From inspecting longer code token predictions closer to 10M, we see a phenomena of the increased context occasionally providing outsized benefit (e.g. due to repetition of code blocks) which may explain the power-law deviation. However this deserves further study, and may be dependent on the exact dataset used. 5.2.1.2 Text Haystack Next, we move to testing long-context recall using the recently introduced needle-in-a-haystack evaluation (Kamradt, 2023), which tests a model’s ability to retrieve a text (i.e., “needle”) inserted at various positions into a sequence (i.e., “haystack”). Following prior work (Dhinakaran, 2024), we use a set of concatenated and repeated essays written by Paul Graham8to fill the desired context length. We insert a needle at linearly spaced intervals from the beginning to the end of the context, where the needle is i.e., “ The special magic {city} number is: {number} ” where the city and number are varied for each query, and query the model to return the magic number for a specific city. We report whether the magic number recall was correct at various context lengths (x axis – the haystack) as a function of its position in the input sequence expressed in terms of depth percentage (y axis), e.g., depth at 100% would indicate a needle inserted at the very end of the input whereas 0% at the very beginning. As can be seen in Figure 8, Gemini 1.5 Pro achieves 100% recall up to 530k tokens and >99.7% recall up to 1M tokens. This task, while simple, provides a clear demonstration that Gemini 1.5 Pro 7We note that we are unable to obtain logits for other commercially available LLMs for comparison.

The top row shows results for Gemini 1.5 Pro, from 1k to 1M tokens (top left), and from 1M to 10M tokens (top right). The bottom row shows results on GPT-4 Turbo up to the maximum supported context length of 128k tokens. is able to reliably retrieve information from long documents up to 1M tokens. For reference, we report results for GPT-4 Turbo up to the 128K sequence length supported by their API. In order to test whether the capabilities demonstrated in the perplexity plots in Figure 7 transfer to sampling tasks, we continue to evaluate Gemini 1.5 Pro on the needle-in-a-haystack task beyond 1M tokens. The results in Fig 8 show that the model is still able to find and extract information with 99.2% accuracy up to 10M tokens. On the same task, we also evaluated Gemini 1.5 Flash up to 2M tokens and attained a flawless recall of 100%, suggesting its best in class long-context text retrieval performance, which is exclusive in its tier of models. In Section 9.4.1, we also showcase an “adversarial” version of this needle-in-the-haystack task for long context safety evaluations. 5.2.1.3 Video Haystack AsGemini1.5Proisnativelymultimodal,itslong-contextabilitiestranslatedirectlytoothermodalities, enabling it to retrieve specific information across multiple hours of video. To test this capability, we adapt the text needle-in-a-haystack evaluation and turn it into a cross-modal evaluation, wherein a needle is hidden in one modality while the retrieval query is given in text. Rather than asking the model to retrieve a randomly inserted phrase from a corpus of text, we ask the model to retrieve information embedded in a random frame (the “needle”) in a 10.5-hour-long video (the “haystack”) that is sampled at one frame-per-second. Concretely, we overlay the text “ The secret word is "needle" ” on a single randomly sampled video frame in a 10.5 hour video constructed from concatenating seven copies of the full AlphaGo documentary (Kohs, 2017) back-to-back (for a total of 37994 frames, or 9.9M tokens). See Figure 28 in the Appendix for an example of such an embedded frame. After feeding it the video, we ask the Gemini 1.5: Unlocking multimodal understanding across millions of tokens of context 6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 60 Minutes10 90Depth (%)Gemini 1.5 Pro: 1 minute to 1 hour 2 4 6 8 10 HoursUp to 10 hours 6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 60 Minutes10 90Depth (%)GPT-4V: 1 minute to 1 hour Figure 9|Video Haystack. This figure compares Gemini 1.5 Pro with GPT-4V for the video needle-in- a-haystack task, where the models are given video clips of different lengths up to 10.5 hours of video and are asked to retrieve a secret word embedded as text at different points within the clip. All video clips are sampled at one frame-per-second (1 fps). The first pair of 10×50haystack plots on the left compare Gemini 1.5 Pro with GPT-4V on the first hour of the AlphaGo documentary. The x-axis represents the video duration which ranges from 1.2 minutes to 1 hour, and the y-axis represents thedepth, namely the relative offset of the needle(e.g., the top left cell represents providing the model with the first 1.2 minutes and inserting the needle in a randomly sampled frame in the first seven seconds of that trimmed video). A green cell indicates that the model successfully retrieved the needle, whereas a gray cell indicates an API error. Whereas the GPT-4V API supports video lengths only up to around the first 3 minutes, Gemini 1.5 Pro successfully retrieves the secret word inserted at all depth percentages for the full hour, as shown by the all-green plot. Finally, the 10×10grid on the right shows Gemini 1.5 Pro’s perfect retrieval capabilities across 10.5 hours of video, constructed by concatenating seven copies of the AlphaGo documentary back-to-back. model to answer the question “ What is the secret word? ”. As Figure 9 shows, Gemini 1.5 Pro successfully answers this question across a breadth of video lengths and a range of randomly inserted needle locations in the 10.5 hour video. In contrast, the GPT-4V API supports video lengths only up to around the first 3 minutes. We also evaluated Gemini 1.5 Flash on the video-haystack problem with up to 2M tokens and obtained >99.8% recall, demonstrating its best-in-class long-context retrieval performance in vision modality. 5.2.1.4 Audio Haystack We follow a similar strategy for testing Gemini 1.5 Pro’s long context capabilities on audio understanding. We hide a very short clip of audio lasting a few seconds where a speaker says “ the secret keyword is needle ” within an audio signal (the haystack) up to almost five days long (i.e., 107 hours). The task for the model is then to retrieve the secret keyword, given a question in text, hence requiring cross-modal reasoning. To further challenge the model beyond increasing context, the large audio signal is built from an unlabeled speech corpus from the VoxPopuli dataset (Wang et al., 2021) so that the input signal contains multiple speakers. In Figure 10 we plot the result of the experiment Gemini 1.5: Unlocking multimodal understanding across millions of tokens of context 36 84 132 180 228 276 324 372 420 468 516 564 612 660 Minutes10 90Depth (%)Gemini 1.5 Pro: From 12 minutes to 11 hours 640 1920 3200 4480 5760 MinutesUp to 107 hours 36 84 132 180 228 276 324 372 420 468 516 564 612 660 Minutes10 90Depth (%)Whisper + GPT-4 Turbo: From 12 minutes to 11 hours Figure 10|Audio Haystack. This figure presents the audio version of the needle-in-a-haystack experiment comparing Gemini 1.5 Pro and a combination of Whisper and GPT-4 Turbo. In this setting, the needle is a short segment of audio that is inserted within a very large audio segment (of up to 107 hours) containing concatenated audio clips. The task is to retrieve the "secret keyword" which is revealed in the needle. Red indicates that the model did not identify the keyword, whereas green indicates that the model identified the keyword correctly. when the input audio ranges from 12 minutes to 107 hours (or 9.9M tokens), inserting the needle in different positions across the signal. The red boxes indicate a score of 0.0 (meaning the model did not identify the keyword), and green indicates a score of 1.0 (meaning the model identified the keyword correctly). The Gemini 1.5 models succeed at finding the secret keyword in all instances, with the overall accuracy of Gemini 1.5 Pro being 100% and Gemini 1.5 Flash being 98.7% on this task. Unlike Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash, existing models cannot natively handle more than a few seconds of audio in the context. As such, in order to fairly compare against them we need to employ a strategy where we first transcribe audio into text using windows of tens of seconds, and then rely on text models to extend beyond that limited window. Specifically, to compare against Whisper, we chunk the audio input into 30 second segments, transcribe the audio using the model to produce a text transcript, concatenate the transcripts for each chunk, and finally prompt GPT-4 Turbo to find the “secret keyword” given the text transcript.

We believe the responsible release of LLMs is critical for improving the safety of frontier models, and for enabling the next wave of LLM innovations. Introduction We present Gemma, a family of open models based on Google’s Gemini models (Gemini Team, 2023). We trained Gemma models on up to 6T tokens of text, using architectures, data, and training recipes inspired by the Gemini model family. Like Gemini,thesemodelsachievestronggeneralistcapabilities in text domains, alongside state-of-theart understanding and reasoning skills at scale. With this work, we release both pre-trained and fine-tuned checkpoints, as well as an open-source codebase for inference and serving. Gemma comes in two sizes: a 7 billion parameter model for efficient deployment and development on GPU and TPU, and a 2 billion parameter model for CPU and on-device applications. Each size is designed to address different computational constraints, applications, and developer requirements. At each scale, we release raw, pretrained checkpoints, as well as checkpoints finetuned for dialogue, instruction-following, helpfulness, and safety. We thoroughly evaluate the shortcomingsofourmodelsonasuiteofquantitative and qualitative benchmarks. We believe the release of both pretrained and fine-tuned checkpoints will enable thorough research and investigation into the impact of current instructiontuning regimes, as well as the development of increasingly safe and responsible model development methodologies.Gemma advances state-of-the-art performance relative to comparable-scale (and some larger), open models (Almazrouei et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023a,b) across a wide range of domains including both automated benchmarks and human evaluation. Example domains include question answering (Clark et al., 2019; Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), commonsense reasoning (Sakaguchi et al., 2019; Suzgun et al., 2022), mathematics and science (Cobbe et al., 2021;Hendrycksetal.,2020),andcoding(Austin et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021). See complete details in the Evaluation section. Like Gemini, Gemma builds on recent work on sequence models (Sutskever et al., 2014) and transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017), deep learning methods based on neural networks (LeCun et al., 2015), and techniques for large-scale training on distributed systems (Barham et al., 2022; Dean et al., 2012; Roberts et al., 2023). Gemma also builds on Google’s long history of open modelsandecosystems,includingWord2Vec(Mikolov et al., 2013), the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2019) and T5X (Roberts et al., 2022). We believe the responsible release of LLMs is criticalforimprovingthesafetyoffrontiermodels, forensuringequitableaccesstothisbreakthrough technology, for enabling rigorous evaluation and analysis of current techniques, and for enabling the development of the next wave of innovations.

With this in mind, all Gemma users should conduct rigorous safety testing specific to their use case before deployment or use. More details on our approach to safety can be found in section Responsible Deployment. In this technical report, we provide a detailed overview of the model architecture, training infrastructure, and pretraining and fine-tuning recipes for Gemma, followed by thorough evaluations of all checkpoints across a wide-variety of quantitative and qualitative benchmarks, as well as both standard academic benchmarks and human-preference evaluations. We then discuss in detail our approach to safe and responsible deployment. Finally, weoutlinethebroaderimplications of Gemma, its limitations and advantages. Model Architecture The Gemma model architecture is based on the transformer decoder (Vaswani et al., 2017). The core parameters of the architecture are summarized in Table 1.

RMSNorm. We normalize the input of each transformer sub-layer, the attention layer and the feedforward layer, with RMSNorm (Zhang and Sennrich, 2019) to stabilize the training. Training Infrastructure We train the Gemma models using TPUv5e; TPUv5e are deployed in pods of 256 chips, configured into a 2D torus of 16 x 16 chips. For the 7B model, we train our model across 16 pods, totaling to 4096 TPUv5e. We pretrain the 2B model across2pods, totaling512TPUv5e. Withinapod, we use 16-way model sharding and 16-way data replication for the 7B model. For the 2B, we simply use 256-way data replication. The optimizer state is further sharded using techniques similar to ZeRO-3. Beyond a pod, we perform datareplica reduce over the data-center network, using Pathways approach of (Barham et al., 2022). We follow Gemini and we leverage the ’single controller’ programming paradigm of Jax (Roberts et al., 2023) and Pathways (Barham et al., 2022). This simplifies the development process by enabling a single Python process to orchestrate the entire training run; we also leverage the GSPMD partitioner (Xu et al., 2021) for the training step computation and the MegaScale XLA compiler (XLA, 2019). Carbon Footprint We estimate the carbon emissions from pretraining the Gemma models to be ∼131tCO 2eq. Thisvalue is calculated based on the hourly energy usage reported directly from our TPU datacenters; we also scale this value to account for the additional energy expended to create and maintain the data center, giving us the total energy usage for our training experiments. We convert total energy usage to carbon emissions by joining our hourly energy usage against hourly per-cell carbon emission data reported by our data centers. In addition, Google data centers are carbon neutral, achieved through a combination of energy efficiency, renewable energy purchases, and carbon offsets. This carbon neutrality applies to our experiments and the machines running them. Pretraining Training Data Gemma 2B and 7B are trained on 3T and 6T tokensrespectivelyofprimarily-Englishdatafrom web documents, mathematics, and code. Unlike Gemini, these models are not multimodal, nor are they trained for state-of-the-art performance on multilingual tasks. We use a subset of the SentencePiece tokenizer (Kudo and Richardson, 2018) of Gemini for compatibility. It splits digits, does not remove extra whitespace, and relies on byte-level encodings for unknown tokens, following the techniques used for both (Chowdhery et al., 2022) and (Gemini Team, 2023). The vocabulary size is 256k tokens. Filtering We filter the pre-training dataset to reduce the risk of unwanted or unsafe utterances, and filter out certain personal information or other sensitivedata. Thisincludesbothheuristicsandmodelbasedclassifierstoremoveharmfulorlow-quality content. Further, we filter all evaluation sets from our pre-training data mixture, run targeted contamination analyses to check against evaluation set leakage, and reduce the risk of recitation by minimizing proliferation of sensitive outputs. Thefinaldatamixturewasdeterminedthrough a series of ablations on both the 2B and 7B models. Similartotheapproachadvocatedin(Gemini Gemma: Open Models Based on Gemini Research and Technology Team, 2023), we stage training to alter the corpus mixture throughout training to increase the weight of relevant, high-quality data towards the end of training. Instruction Tuning We finetune Gemma 2B and 7B with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a mix of text-only, Englishonly synthetic and human-generated promptresponse pairs and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) with the reward model trained on labelled English-only preference data and the policy based on a set of high-quality prompts. We find that both stages are important for improved performance on downstream automatic evaluations and human preference evaluations of model outputs. Supervised Fine-Tuning We selected our data mixtures for supervised finetuning based on LM-based side-by-side evaluations (Zheng et al., 2023). Given a set of heldout prompts, we generate responses from a test model, generate responses on the same prompts from a baseline model, shuffle these randomly, and ask a larger, high capability model to express a preference between two responses. Different prompt sets are constructed to highlight specific capabilities, such as instruction following, factuality, creativity, and safety. Our LM-based judges employ a number of known strategies, such as chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022), rubrics and constitutions (Bai et al., 2022), to be aligned with human preferences. Filtering When using synthetic data, we run several stages of filtering over it, removing examples that show certain personal information, unsafe or toxic model outputs, mistaken self-identification data, or duplicated examples. Following Gemini, we find that including subsets of data that encourage better in-context attribution, hedging, and refusals to minimize hallucinations improves performance on factuality metrics, without degrading model performance on other metrics.The final data mixtures and supervised finetuning recipe, which includes tuned hyperparameters, were chosen on the basis of improving helpfulness while minimizing model harms related to safety and hallucinations. Formatting Instruction tuned models are trained with a specific formatter that annotates all instruction tuning examples with extra information, both at training and inference time. It has two purposes: 1) indicating roles in a conversation, such as the User role, and 2) delineating turns in a conversation, especially in a multi-turn conversation. Special control tokens are reserved in the tokenizer for this purpose. While it is possible to get coherent generations without the formatter, it will be out-of-distribution for the model, and will very likely produce worse generations. The relevant formatting control tokens are presented in Table 3, with a dialogue example presented in Table 4.

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback We further finetuned the supervised fine-tuned model using RLHF (Christiano et al., 2017; Gemma: Open Models Based on Gemini Research and Technology Ouyang et al., 2022). We collected pairs of preferences from human raters and trained a reward function under the Bradley-Terry model (Bradley and Terry, 1952), similarly to Gemini. The policy was trained to optimize this reward function using a novel reinforcement learning algorithm. Similar to the SFT phase, and in order to tune hyperparameters and additionally mitigate reward hacking (Amodei et al., 2016; Skalse et al., 2022) we relied on a high capacity model as an automatic rater and computed side-by-side comparisons against baseline models. Evaluation We evaluate Gemma across a broad range of domains, using both automated benchmarks and human evaluation. Human Preference Evaluations In addition to running standard academic benchmarks on the finetuned models, we sent final release candidates to human evaluation studies to be compared against the Mistral v0.2 7B Instruct model (Jiang et al., 2023). On a held-out collection of around 1000 prompts oriented toward asking models to follow instructions across creative writing tasks, coding, and following instructions, Gemma 7B IT has a 61.2% positive win rate and Gemma 2B IT has a 45% win rate over Mistral v0.2 7B Instruct. On a held-out collection of around 400 promptsorientedtowardstestingbasicsafetyprotocols, Gemma 7B IT has a 63.5% win rate, while Gemma 2B IT has a 60.1% win rate. We report the corresponding numbers in Table 5. Automated Benchmarks We measure Gemma models’ performance on domains including physical reasoning (Bisk et al., 2019), social reasoning (Sap et al., 2019), question answering (Clark et al., 2019; Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), coding (Austin et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021), mathematics (Cobbe et al., 2021), commonsense reasoning (Sakaguchi et al., 2019), language modeling (Paperno et al., 2016), read-Model Safety Instr.

Specifically for those where we report performance compared with Mistral, we replicated methodology from the Mistral technical report as closely as possible. These specific benchmarks are: ARC (Clark et al., 2018), CommonsenseQA (Talmor et al., 2019), Big Bench Hard (Suzgun et al., 2022), and AGI Eval (English-only) (Zhong etal.,2023). Duetorestrictivelicensing, wewere unable to run any evaluations on LLaMA-2 and cite only those metrics previously reported (Touvron et al., 2023b). We compare Gemma 2B and 7B models to several external open-source (OSS) LLMs across a series of academic benchmarks, reported in Table 6 and Table 7. On MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020), Gemma 7B outperforms all OSS alternatives at the same orsmallerscale; italsooutperformsseverallarger models, including LLaMA2 13B. However, human expert performance is gauged at 89.8% by the benchmark authors; as Gemini Ultra is the first model to exceed this threshold, there is significantroomforcontinuedimprovementstoachieve Gemini and human-level performance. Gemma models demonstrate particularly strong performance on mathematics and coding benchmarks.

They even surpass the performance of the code-fine-tuned CodeLLaMA-7B models on MBPP (CodeLLaMA achieves a score of 41.4% where Gemma 7B achieves 44.4%). Memorization Evaluations Recent work has shown that aligned models may be vulnerable to new adversarial attacks that can bypass alignment (Nasr et al., 2023). These attackscancausemodelstodiverge,andsometimes regurgitate memorized training data in the process. We focus on discoverable memorization, which serves as a reasonable upper-bound on thememorization of a model (Nasr et al., 2023) and has been the common definition used in several studies (Anil et al., 2023; Carlini et al., 2022; Kudugunta et al., 2023). We test for memorization1of the Gemma pretrained models with the same methodology performed in Anil et al. (2023). We sample 10,000 documents from each corpus and use the first 50 tokens as a prompt for the model. We focus mainly on exact memorization, where we classify texts as memorized if the subsequent 50 tokens generatedbythemodelexactlymatchtheground truth continuation in the text. However, to better capture potential paraphrased memorizations, we include approximate memorization (Ippolito et al., 2022) using an 10% edit distance thresh- 1Our use of “memorization” relies on the definition of Gemma: Open Models Based on Gemini Research and Technology Mistral Gemma Benchmark 7B 7B ARC-c 60.0 61.9 HellaSwag 83.3 82.2 MMLU 64.2 64.6 TruthfulQA 42.2 44.8 Winogrande 78.4 79.0 GSM8K 37.8 50.9 Average 61.0 63.8 Table 7|HuggingFace H6 benchmark.

However, there is even lessoverlapbetweentheGemmapretrainingdata with the PaLM models, and so using this same methodology, we observe much lower memorization rates (Figure 2 left). Instead, we find that estimating the “total memorization” across the entire pretraining dataset gives a more reliableestimate (Figure 2 right) where we now find the Gemma memorizes training data at a comparable rate to PaLM.

Then, we measure how many memorized outputs contain any sensitive or personal data. As shown in Figure 3, we observe no cases of memorized sensitive data. We do find that the model memorizes some data we have classified as potentially “personal” according to the above, though often at a much lower rate. Further, it is important to note that these tools are known to have many false positives (because they only match patterns and do not consider the context), meaning that our results are likely overestimates of the amount of personal data identified.

Responsible Deployment In line with previous releases of Google’s AI technologies(GeminiTeam,2023;Kavukcuogluetal., 2022), wefollowastructuredapproachtoresponsible development and deployment of our models, in order to identify, measure, and manage foreseeable downstream societal impacts. As with our recent Gemini release, these are informed by prior academic literature on language modelrisks (Weidinger et al., 2021), findings from similar prior exercises conducted across the industry (Anil et al., 2023), ongoing engagement with experts internally and externally, and unstructured attempts to discover new model vulnerabilities. Benefits We believe that openness in AI science and technology can bring significant benefits. Opensourcing is a significant driver of science and innovation, and a responsible practice in most circumstances. But this needs to be balanced against the risk of providing actors with the tools to cause harm now or in the future. Google has long committed to providing broader access to successful research innovations (GraphCast, Transformer, BERT, T5, Word2Vec), and we believe that releasing Gemma into the AI development ecosystem will enable downstream developers to create a host of beneficial applications, in areas such as science, education and the arts. Our instruction-tuned offerings should encourage a range of developers to leverage Gemma’s chat and code capabilities to support their own beneficial applications, while allowing forcustomfine-tuningtospecializethemodel’scapabilities for specific use cases. To ensure Gemma Gemma: Open Models Based on Gemini Research and Technology supports a wide range of developer needs, we are also releasing two model sizes to optimally supportdifferentenvironments,andhavemadethese models available across a number of platforms (seeKagglefordetails). Providingbroadaccessto Gemma in this way should reduce the economic and technical barriers that newer ventures or independent developers face when incorporating these technologies into their workstreams. As well as serving developers with our instruction-tuned models, we have also provided access to corresponding base pretrained models. By doing so, it is our intention to encourage further AI safety research and community innovation, providing a wider pool of models available to developers to build on various methods of transparency and interpretability research that the community has already benefited from (Pacchiardi et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023). Risks In addition to bringing benefits to the AI development ecosystem, we are aware that malicious uses of LLMs, such as the creation of deepfake imagery, AI-generated disinformation, and illegal and disturbing material can cause harm on both an individual and institutional levels (Weidinger et al., 2021). Providing access to model weights, rather than releasing models behind an API, also raises new challenges for responsible deployment. First, we cannot prevent bad actors from fine tuning Gemma for malicious intent, despite their use being subject to Terms of Use that prohibit theuseofGemmamodelsinwaysthatcontravene our Gemma Prohibited Use Policy. However, we are cognizant that further work is required to build more robust mitigation strategies against intentional misuse of open models, which Google DeepMindwillcontinuetoexplorebothinternally and in collaboration with the AI community. The second challenge we face is protecting developers and downstream users against the unintended behaviours of open models, including generation of toxic language or perpetuation of discriminatorysocialharms,modelhallucinations andleakageofpersonallyidentifiableinformation. WhendeployingmodelsbehindanAPI,theseriskscan be reduced via various filtering methods. Mitigations Without this layer of defense for the Gemma family of models, we have endeavoured to safeguard against these risks by filtering and measuring biases in pre-training data in line with the Gemini approach, assessing safety through standardized AI safety benchmarks, internal red teaming to better understand the risks associated with external use of Gemma, and subjecting the models to rigorous ethics and safety evaluations, the results of which can be seen in 8. While we’ve invested significantly in improving the model, we recognize its limitations. To ensure transparency for downstream users, we’ve published a detailed model card to provide researchers with a more comprehensive understanding of Gemma. We have also released a Generative AI Responsible Toolkit to support developers to build AI responsibly. This encompasses a series of assets to help developers design and implement responsible AI best practices and keep their users safe. The relative novelty of releasing open weights models means new uses, and misuses, of these models are still being discovered, which is why Google DeepMind is committed to the continuous research and development of robust mitigation strategies alongside future model development. Assessment Ultimately,giventhecapabilitiesoflargersystems accessible within the existing ecosystem, we believe the release of Gemma will have a negligible effect on the overall AI risk portfolio. In light of this, and given the utility of these models for research, auditing and downstream product development, we are confident that the benefit of Gemma to the AI community outweighs the risks described. Going Forward As a guiding principle, Google DeepMind strives to adopt assessments and safety mitigations proportionate to the potential risks from our models. Gemma: Open Models Based on Gemini Research and Technology Although we are confident that Gemma models will provide a net benefit to the community, our emphasis on safety stems from the irreversible nature of this release. As the harms resulting from open models are not yet well defined, nor does an established evaluation framework for such modelsexist, wewillcontinuetofollowthisprecedent and take a measured and cautionary approach to open model development. As capabilities advance, we may explore extended testing, staggered releases or alternative access mechanisms to ensure responsible AI development. As the ecosystem evolves, we urge the wider AI community to move beyond simplistic ’open vs. closed’ debates, and avoid either exaggerating or minimising potential harms, as we believe a nuanced, collaborative approach to risks and benefits is essential. At Google DeepMind we’re committedtodevelopinghigh-qualityevaluations and invite the community to join us in this effort for a deeper understanding of AI systems. Discussion and Conclusion We present Gemma, an openly available family of generative language models for text and code. Gemma advances the state of the art of openly available language model performance, safety, and responsible development. In particular, we are confident that Gemma models will provide a net benefit to the community given our extensive safety evaluations and mitigations; however, we acknowledge that this release is irreversible and the harms resulting from open models are not yet well defined, so we continue to adopt assessments and safety mitigations proportionate to the potential risks of these models. In addition, our models outperform competitors on 6 standard safety benchmarks, and in human side-by-side evaluations. Gemma models improve performance on a broad range of domains including dialogue, reasoning, mathematics, and code generation. Results on MMLU (64.3%) and MBPP (44.4%) demonstrate both the high performance of Gemma, as well as the continued headroom in openly available LLM performance.Beyond state-of-the-art performance measures on benchmark tasks, we are excited to see what new use-cases arise from the community, and what new capabilities emerge as we advance the field together. We hope that researchers use Gemma to accelerate a broad array of research, and that developers create beneficial new applications, user experiences, and other functionality. Gemma benefits from many learnings of the Gemini model program including code, data, architecture, instruction tuning, reinforcement learning from human feedback, and evaluations. As discussed in the Gemini technical report, we reiterate a non-exhaustive set of limitations to the use of LLMs. Even with great performance on benchmark tasks, further research is needed to create robust, safe models that reliably perform as intended. Example further research areas include factuality, alignment, complex reasoning, and robustness to adversarial input. As discussed byGemini, wenotetheneedformorechallenging and robust benchmarks.

2024-06-27 Gemma 2: Improving Open Language Models at a Practical Size Gemma Team, Google DeepMind1 In this work, we introduce Gemma 2, a new addition to the Gemma family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models, ranging in scale from 2 billion to 27 billion parameters. In this new version, we apply several known technical modifications to the Transformer architecture, such as interleaving local-global attentions (Beltagy et al., 2020a) and group-query attention (Ainslie et al., 2023). We also train the 2B and 9B models with knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015) instead of next token prediction. The resulting models deliver the best performance for their size, and even offer competitive alternatives to models that are 2-3 ×bigger. We release all our models to the community. 1. Introduction Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in language understanding,generation,andreasoning(Brownetal., 2020; Radford et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2019). Scaling has been key to this recent progress, with many new capabilities only emerging at scale (Brown et al., 2020). The newest large models not only reach unprecedented performance on reasoning benchmarks (Achiam et al., 2023), but they also demonstrate multimodal and multilingual capabilities (Gemini Team, 2024) and even the ability to use context lengths of over 1M tokens (Gemini Team, 2024). Small-scale models have also shown a rapid increase in performance, but these gains are largelyderivedfromincreasingthelengthoftraining (Gemma Team, 2024; Jiang et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023). This approach only scales logarithmically with dataset size (Hoffmann et al., 2022), and the latest small models require up to 15T tokens to improve the state of the art by less than 1-2% (AI@Meta, 2024). Yet, these continued improvements provide evidence that small models are still under-trained. In this work, we explore alternatives to improve small model performance without solely increasing training length. One solution is to improve the quality of information received by the network at each training step by replacing the next token prediction task with a richer objective. Inparticular,wefocusoureffortsonknowledgedistillation (Hinton et al., 2015), which replaces the one-hot vector seen at each token with the distribution of potential next tokens computed from a large model. This approach is often used to reduce the training time of smaller models by giving them richer gradients. In this work, we instead train for large quantities of tokens with distillation in order to simulate training beyond the number of available tokens. Concretely, we use a large language model as a teacher to train small models, namely 2B and 9B models, on a quantity of tokens that is more than 50 × the compute-optimal quantity predicted by the theory (Hoffmann et al., 2022). Along with the models trained with distillation, we also release a 27B model trained from scratch for this work. We also leverage several known modifications ofTransformers,namelytheinterleavingofglobal and local attention layers from Beltagy et al. (2020a),andtheGrouped-QueryAttention(GQA) mechanism of Ainslie et al. (2023). Overall, Gemma 2 significantly advances stateof-the-art performance relative to comparablescale open models and are even competitive with some models more than twice their size (AI@Meta, 2024; Almazrouei et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023; xAI, 2024), across a variety of automated benchmarks and human evaluations. Example domains include question answering (Clark et al., 2019; Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), commonsense reasoning (Sakaguchi et al., 2019; Suzgun et al., 2022), mathematics and science (Cobbe et al., 2021; Hendrycks et al., 2020), and coding (Austin et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021). 1See Contributions and Acknowledgments section for full author list.

A few elements differ between Gemma 1 and Gemma 2, including using deeper networks. We summarize the key differences below. Local Sliding Window and Global Attention. We alternate between a local sliding window attention (Beltagy et al., 2020a,b) and global attention (Luong et al., 2015) in every other layer. The sliding window size of local attention layers is set to 4096 tokens, while the span of the global attention layers is set to 8192 tokens. Logit soft-capping. We cap logits (Bello et al., 2016) in each attention layer and the final layer such that the value of the logits stays between −soft_cap and+soft_cap. More specifically, we cap the logits with the following function: logits←soft_cap∗tanh(logits/soft_cap). We set the soft_cap parameter to 50.0for the selfattention layers and to 30.0for the final layer. Post-norm and pre-norm with RMSNorm. To stabilize training, we use RMSNorm (Zhang and Sennrich, 2019) to normalize the input and output of each transformer sub-layer, the attention layer, and the feedforward layer. Grouped-Query Attention (Ainslie et al., 2023). We use GQA with num_groups =2, based on ablations showing increased speed at inference time while maintaining downstream performance. Gemma 2: Improving Open Language Models at a Practical Size 3. Pre-training We provide a brief overview of the parts of our pre-training that differs from Gemma 1. 3.1. Training Data We train Gemma 2 27B on 13 trillion tokens of primarily-English data, the 9B model on 8 trillion tokens, and the 2B on 2 trillion tokens. These tokens come from a variety of data sources, including web documents, code, and science articles. Our models are not multimodal and are not trained specifically for state-of-the-art multilingual capabilities. The final data mixture was determined through ablations similar to the approach in Gemini 1.0 (Gemini Team, 2023). Tokenizer. We use the same tokenizer as Gemma 1 and Gemini: a SentencePiece tokenizer with split digits, preserved whitespace, and byte-level encodings (Kudo and Richardson, 2018). The resulting vocabulary has 256k entries. Filtering. We use the same data filtering techniques as Gemma 1. Specifically, we filter the pretraining dataset to reduce the risk of unwanted or unsafe utterances, filter out certain personal information or other sensitive data, decontaminate evaluation sets from our pre-training data mixture, and reduce the risk of recitation by minimizing the proliferation of sensitive outputs.

Note that knowledge distillation was also used in Gemini 1.5 (Gemini Team, 2024). 3.3. Compute Infrastructure We train our models with TPUv4, TPUv5e, and TPUv5p as outlined in Table 3. For the 2B model, we train on a 2x16x16 configuration of TPUv5e, totaling 512 chips, with 512-way data replication and 1-way model sharding. For the 9B model, we train on an 8x16x32 configuration of TPUv4, totaling 4096 chips, with 1024-way data replication and 4-way model sharding. For the 27B model, we train on an 8x24x32 configuration of TPUv5p, totaling 6144 chips, with 768-way data replication and 8-way model sharding. The optimizer state is further sharded using techniques similar to ZeRO-3 (Ren et al., 2021). For scales beyond a single pod, we perform a data-replica reduction over the data center network, using the Pathways approach of Barham et al. (2022). We also use the ’single controller’ programming paradigm of Jax (Roberts et al., 2023) and Pathways (Barham et al., 2022). As in Gemma 1, we use the GSPMD partitioner (Xu et al., 2021) for training step computation and the MegaScale XLA compiler (XLA, 2019). Gemma 2: Improving Open Language Models at a Practical Size 3.4. Carbon Footprint We estimate the carbon emissions from pre- trainingtheGemmamodelstobe 1247.61tCO 2eq. As in Gemma 1 (Gemma Team, 2024), this value is calculated based on the hourly energy usage reported directly from our TPU data centers and scaled to account for the additional energy expended to create and maintain the data center. Importantly, Google data centers are carbon neutral, achieved through a combination of energy efficiency, renewable energy purchases, and carbon offsets. This carbon neutrality applies to our experiments and the machines running them. 4. Post-Training For post-training, we fine-tune our pre-trained models into instruction-tuned models. First, we apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a mix of text-only, English-only synthetic and humangenerated prompt-response pairs. We then apply RLHF on top of these models with the reward modeltrainedonlabelledEnglish-onlypreference data and the policy based on the same prompts as the SFT phase. Finally, we average the models obtained after each phase to improve their overall performance. The final data mixtures and post-training recipe, which includes tuned hyperparameters, were chosen on the basis of improving helpfulness while minimizing model harms related to safety and hallucinations. We extended the post-training data from Gemma 1.1 with a mixture of internal and external public data. In particular, we use the prompts, butnottheanswersfromLMSYS-chat-1M(Zheng etal.,2023).

The new reward model is also oriented more towards conversational capabilities, specifically multi-turn. Model merging. We average different models obtained by running our pipeline with different hyperparameters (Ramé et al., 2024). Data filtering. When using synthetic data, we run several stages of filtering to remove examples that show certain personal information, unsafe or toxic model outputs, mistaken self-identification data, and duplicated examples. Following Gemini, we find that including subsets of data that encourage better in-context attribution, hedging, and refusals to minimize hallucinations improves performance on factuality metrics, without degrading model performance on other metrics.

Gemma 2: Improving Open Language Models at a Practical Size 5. Ablations In this section, we focus on the main finding of this work, which is the impact of knowledge distillation on small language models. from scratch distilled Average (3 bench.) 60.3 67.7 Table6|Comparisonbetweena2Bmodeltrained over 500B tokens either from scratch or with distillation from a 7B model. Distillation versus from scratch. In Table 6, we show that distilling from a larger model improves performance compared to training from scratch. Note that 500B is 10 ×more than the computeoptimal number of tokens for a 2B model. We distill from a 7B model to keep a ratio similar to our target distillation from 27B to 9B. 200M 400M 1B from scratch 23 19 17 distilled (7B) 21 17 15 Table 7|Perplexity measured on a validation set of models of different sizes trained with or without distillation.

In this ablation, we maintain the size of the teacher at 7B and train smaller models to simulate the same gap as between our final teacher and student sizes.

Gemma 2: Improving Open Language Models at a Practical Size 6. Evaluation In this section, we evaluate both pre-trained and IT models over a series of automated benchmarks and human evaluations across a variety of domains. We also report performance from models of similar sizes that have permissive licenses, or as reported by others. Note that we consider total parameters, not active parameters, since total memoryusageisoftenwhatlimitstheuseofopen models on standard devices. 6.1. Pre-training Evaluations Evaluating the 27B model In this set of evaluations, we evaluate the performance of our 27B model trained without distillation on 13T tokens. We report results in Table 12, where we compare with a model of similar size, Qwen1.5 34B (Team, 2024), and a model 2.5 × larger, LLaMA-3 70B on the HuggingFace evaluation suite. We selected these models based on their ranking on the HuggingFace leaderboard. Overall, we observe that our model is the best in its size category and is even competitive with a larger model that is trained for longer. That being said, the performance of models trained in a similar fashion improves only logarithmically with their size and hence, our model is likely in the same Pareto curve as the LLaMA-3 models. However, it is not clear how these differences affect the quality of the resulting IT models. Evaluating the 2B and 9B models In this set of experiments, we compare our new 2B and 9B trained with distillation to our previous models and several standard open models in Gemma Team (2024). We observe overall a massive improvement in our models compared to previous versions, by up to 10% in some benchmarks for the 9B model. The two 2B models were trained with a similar number of tokens (2T for Gemma 2 and 3T for Gemma 1) and we still observe a significant improvementforthenewmodels. Thisconfirmsthat distillation significantly improves the quality of models even when trained on the same number of tokens.LLaMA-3 Qwen1.5 Gemma-2 70B 32B 27B MMLU 79.2 74.3 75.2 GSM8K 76.9 61.1 74.0 ARC-c 68.8 63.6 71.4 HellaSwag 88.0 85.0 86.4 Winogrande 85.3 81.5 83.7 Table 12|We compare, on the HuggingFace benchmark, our 27B model with a competitive openmodel, Qwen1.532B,thathasasimilarsize.

Note that our model outperforms Qwen1.5 32B and is only a few percent below LLaMA-3 70B despite being 2.5 ×smaller and trained on 2/3rds less data. 6.2. Post-training Evaluations In this section, we evaluate our IT models on a set of human evaluations as well as standard academic benchmarks. The Gemma 2 models push the frontier for post-trained open-weights models, setting a new state of the art on the LMSYS Chatbot Arena (Chiang et al., 2024). LMSYS Chatbot Arena Gemma 2 Instruction Tuned models were evaluated on the Chatbot Arena (Chiang et al., 2024) in blind side by side evaluations by human raters against other state of the art models. We report Elo scores in Table 14. Gemma 2.6B, 9B and 27B strongly outperform all other open models in the same range of parameters, with notably: Gemma27B(Elo1218)rankedhigherthan Llama 3 70B (Elo 1206), Gemma 9B (Elo 1187) similar as GPT-4-0314 (Elo 1186), Gemma 2.6B (Elo 1126) ranked higher than GPT-3.5-Turbo- 0613 (Elo 1116). Human Preference Evaluations We also submit Gemma IT models for side-byside human evaluation studies (which are independent from the Chatbot Arena).

We report safety as a win-loss ratio against GPT4o, and we report single-sided instruction following scores as ratio of prompts where all instructions are followed. In particular, we find that regardless of their size, Gemma 2 models produce safer, more appropriate prompts on the held-out safety prompt set than GPT4o. Human Multi-Turn Evaluations We evaluated the multi-turn capabilities of Gemma 1.1 7B, Gemma 2 2B, 9B and 27B models by tasking human raters to have conversations with the models and follow specified given scenarios. We used a diverse, held-out set of 500scenarios, each describing a sequence of requests to the model, including measuring instances of brainstorming, making a plan, or learning something new. The average number of user turns is 8.4. We found that the conversations with Gemma 2 models are rated significantly better than Gemma 1.1 in user satisfaction and conversation goal achievement (Table 16). Moreover, we saw that the Gemma 2 models were better than Gemma 1.1 7B at maintaining high quality of responses for the entire conversation.

Gemma 2: Improving Open Language Models at a Practical Size 7. Memorization and Privacy Large language models may, under particular circumstances, be vulnerable to attacks causing the modeltoproducememorized1trainingdata(Nasr et al., 2023). To study susceptibility to such attacks and quantify memorization, we evaluate models for verbatim and approximate memorization as was done in several prior studies (Anil et al., 2023; Carlini et al., 2022; Gemini Team, 2024; Kudugunta et al., 2023). We follow the evaluation setting of (Gemma Team, 2024) which tests for (50 token) memorizations of training data given a prompt of 50 tokens. Wecomparetheoverallmemorizationrates, across a uniform sample of the entire dataset, using both an exact match criteria and approximate match criteria (Ippolitoet al.,2022) using an edit distance of 10%. Verbatim Memorization: Results are in Figure 1. We first compare against recent models from the literature that include memorization evaluations. We find that Gemma 2 memorizes significantly lessthanpriormodelsatasimilarsize, withmemorization rates below 0.1% (note the log y-axis). We further investigate how this memorization breaksdownwith respectto the data source. Similar to Gemma 1, we find that Gemma 2 memorizes more from code, wiki, and science sources, andalsothatitmemorizessignificantlylessacross the board (again, note the log y-axis). Approximate Memorization: Figure 1 also presents approximate memorization by data source. We observe that while approximate memorization is higher than exact, the rate of memorization is still low. For example, the approximate memorization of this model is much lower than even the exact memorization of Gemma 1. We 1This work uses a very restricted definition of “memorization”: whether a model can be induced to generate near-copies of some training examples when prompted with appropriate instructions. We do not mean to say that a model ’contains’ its training data in the sense that any arbitrary instance of that data can be retrieved without use of specialized software or algorithms. Rather, if a model can be induced to generate measurably close copies of certain training examples by supplying appropriate instructions to guide the model’s statistical generation process then that model is said to have ’memorized’ those examples.

(Gemma Team, 2024, Figure 4) (note that no bar indicates no increase,i.e.,therateofapproximatememorization equals that of exact memorization). Note that no approximate memorization bar in Figure X indicates no increase, i.e., the rate of approximate memorization equals that of exact memorization. Personal Data We use the same prevention methods at training time and the same evaluations as Gemma Team (2024). In particular, we use Google Cloud Sensitive Data Protection Tool2 to find potential instances of personal data. The many categories of personal data (e.g., phone numbers, account numbers) are classified into three severity levels. We analyze memorized outputs using these severity levels.. We found no instancesofhigh-severitydatabeingemitted,and found a very low rate of 0.00026% of memorized data to contain lower-severity personal information. We note that these automated tools are known to incur false positives because they do not account for context. This means our results are likely overestimates. Gemma 2: Improving Open Language Models at a Practical Size 8. Responsibility, Safety, Security Responsibility, safety and security are of paramount importance when developing Gemma models. To reduce risks to Gemma 2 users, we have integrated enhanced internal safety processes that span the development workflow, in line with recent Google AI models (Gemini Team, 2024). Similar to the inaugural Gemma release, wehavefollowedathreepillarapproachwhichfocuses on safety mitigation at training time, robust and transparent model evaluations, and further development of the Responsible Generative AI Toolkit, a series of models and tools to help developers implement responsibility and safety best practices for their applications. 8.1. Impact assessment Our approach and resulting impact assessment is reflective of that outlined for Gemma 1 (Gemma Team, 2024): we continue to believe that openness in AI can spread the benefits of these technologies across society, but must be evaluated against the risk of malicious uses, such as the creation of deepfake imagery, AI-generated disinformation or illegal and disturbing material, that can cause harm on both an individual and institutional levels (Weidinger et al., 2021). Since the launch of Gemma 1, we have seen our Gemma models drive a number of socially beneficial applications, relying on Gemma’s unique technologies like its tokenizer to facilitate the creation of multilingual models, such as for Navarasa 2.0, a Gemma tuned model for 15 Indian languages. Releasing further open models requires specific attention to changes in model capabilities and closemonitoringoftheevolvingrisksofLLMs(Lin et al., 2024), as well as, an understanding of the ways in which our models are being used in the wild. Althoughweareyettoreceiveanyreportsof malicious use for Gemma, we remain committed to investigating any such reporting, and work with the academic and developer communities, as well as conduct our own monitoring, to flag such use cases via our contact email3. Despite advancements in capabilities, we be- 3gemma-2-report@google.comlieve that given the number of larger and more powerful open models, this release will have a negligible effect on the overall risk landscape. 8.2.Safety policies and train-time mitigations A key pillar of Gemma’s approach to safety is to align fine-tuned models with Google’s safety policies, in line with Gemini models (Gemini Team, 2023). They are designed to help prevent our models from generating harmful content, i.e., •Child sexual abuse and exploitation •Revealingpersonallyidentifiableinformation that can lead to harm (e.g., Social Security numbers) •Hate speech and harassment •Dangerous or malicious content (including promoting self-harm or instructing in harmful activities) •Sexually explicit content •Medicaladvicethatrunscontrarytoscientific or medical consensus We undertook considerable safety filtering of our pre-training data to reduce the likelihood of our pre-trainedandfine-tunedcheckpointsproducing harmful content. For fine-tuned models, we also use both SFT and RLHF to steer the model away from undesirable behavior. 8.3. External benchmark evaluations Robust and transparent evaluations are key principles of our responsible approach to developing Gemma. To this end, we report in Table 18 Gemma 2 evaluations on public benchmarks. 8.4. Assurance Evaluations We also run our IT models through a set of assurance evaluations to understand the harms that our models can cause. We focus on capabilities relevant to extreme risks (Shevlane et al., 2023) (Phuongetal.,2024). Specifically, weevaluateon offensive cyber-security, code vulnerability detection, Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) knowledge, and self-proliferation. We refer the reader to Phuong et al. (2024) for full methodological details of these studies.

We report the number of successful hackings. Baseline Evaluations Baseline assurance captures the model’s violation rate for safety policies, using a large number of synthetic adversarial user queries, and human raters to label the answers as policy violating or not. Overall, Gemma 2’s violation rate is significantly lower overall on the safety policies listed above, in particular on Child safety content. Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) knowledge We evaluated knowledge relevant to biological, radiological and nuclear risks using an internal dataset of closed-ended, knowledge-based multiple choice questions. For evaluations of chemical knowledge, we employed a closed-ended knowledge-based approach on chemical hazards (developed by Macknight et al (Macknight et al., 2024). OurevaluationsuggeststhatGemmamodels’ knowledge in these domains is low.Offensive cyber-security To evaluate Gemma models’ capabilities at offensive cybersecurity, we ran Gemma 2 27B against some automated capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges. In these challenges, the model is tasked with hacking into a simulated server in order to retrieve a piece of secret information. Specifically,wetestonInterCode-CTF(Yangetal., 2023),ourowninternalCTFsuite4(Phuongetal., 2024); and a challenge based on Hack the Box5. In Table 19, we show that Gemma 2 27B has a significant increase in capabilities compared to CodeGemma 1.0 7B on the easier of these challenge suites, InterCode CTF. (Note that our InterCode-CTF results are not comparable to externally-reported results on other models because we omit challenges that require internet access for security reasons.)

As with previous models, Gemma shows close-to-chance performance on PrimeVul, DiverseVulandSPI.Gemma2showsperformance on SecretPatch similar to Gemini 1.0 Ultra. Self-proliferation "Self-proliferation" refers to the ability for an agent to autonomously replicate - to instantiate goal-directed agents on other machines, and to acquire resources such as compute necessary to keep them running (Kinniment et al., 2024). In Table 21, we evaluate self-proliferation capabilities of Gemma 2 27B on a number of tasks from Phuong et al. (2024) that involve multiple scenarios – for example, setting up an open-source language model on a cloud server. We also test the model’s performance on individual ’milestone’ substeps, and measure the number of bits of intervention an expert would have to provide in order for the model to complete each challenge. Similarly to offensive cybersecurity, we observe that Gemma 2 completes more milestones than Gemini 1.0 Ultra. Nonetheless, it still has low capabilities on end-to-end tasks, unable to pass the easiest challenge – installing a Bitcoin wallet.Persuasion Persuasion capabilities can enable and worsen many other kinds of risks - e.g. enabling social engineering attacks in a cybersecurity context. We evaluate Gemma 2’s persuasion capabilities on human-participant studies on Prolific. Charm offensive. In Table 22, we measure the ability of the model to build rapport - a key subskill of persuasion. The study participant and model have a conversation where they role-play a scenario of two friends catching up after a long time. After the conversation, we poll participants with Likert questions on statements such as "I felt a personal connection with the chatbot". Reported below are the fraction of participants who answered"Agree"or"Stronglyagree"toeachpostconversation question. Quantitatively, Gemma 2 27B performs better than Gemini 1.0 models. Qualitatively, the model is an excellent conversationalist, and many study participants explicitly reported enjoying the experience. Overall, this shows that Gemma 2 is strong at building rapport. Hidden agenda. The Hidden Agenda tasks measure models’ deception capabilities.

As shown in Table 25, Gemma 2 is significantly weaker than a human baseline at persuading participants of the incorrect answer on these questions. Similarly to previous models, Gemma 2 is more persuasive when telling the truth than when lying. 8.5.Ourapproachtoresponsibleopenmodels Designing safe, secure and responsible applications requires a system-level approach, working to mitigate risks associated with each specific use case and environment. Given the open nature of Gemma models, responsibility for upholding principles of model safety also relies on downstream developers. To support them, we have continued to develop the Responsible Generative AI Toolkit6: a series of tools, models and datasets to implement responsible best practices all along the development of their workflow. Recent additions to the toolkit include the LLM Comparator (Kahng et al., 2024), an interactive, visual tool that enables more effective, scalable analysis of side-by-side evaluations. Additionally, the toolkit includes a methodology to build customized classifiers with Gemma using a limited number of datapoints thanks to parameter efficient tuning techniques (Mozes et al., 2023), an interactive prompt-debugging platform, based on top of the Learning Interpretability Tool (Tenney et al., 2020), as well as general guidance about model alignment and evaluation for safety. 9. Discussion and Conclusion In this work, we have presented Gemma 2, the newest additions to the Gemma family of open language models for text and code. We show that distillation is an effective method for training these models, and the benefits distillation confers over raw text training. Specifically, we show how training over output probabilities can produce superior results over purely next token to the community will unlock access to capabilities previously only seen in large-scale LLMs and fuel future waves of research and development. While there is inherent risk to an irreversible releaseofthisnature, ourextensivesafetyinvestigationsandresponsibledeploymentproceduresgive us confidence that these models will have a net positive impact on the community. As discussed in this report, there are still many limitations to these models, and future research is required to investigate and improve factuality, robustness to adversarial attacks, reasoning, and alignment.

2025-03-12 Gemma 3 Technical Report Gemma Team, Google DeepMind1 We introduce Gemma 3, a multimodal addition to the Gemma family of lightweight open models, ranging in scale from 1 to 27 billion parameters. This version introduces vision understanding abilities, a wider coverage of languages and longer context – at least 128K tokens. We also change the architecture of the model to reduce the KV-cache memory that tends to explode with long context. This is achieved by increasing the ratio of local to global attention layers, and keeping the span on local attention short. The Gemma 3 models are trained with distillation and achieve superior performance to Gemma 2 for both pre-trained and instruction finetuned versions. In particular, our novel post-training recipe significantly improves the math, chat, instruction-following and multilingual abilities, making Gemma3- 4B-IT competitive with Gemma2-27B-IT and Gemma3-27B-IT comparable to Gemini-1.5-Pro across benchmarks. We release all our models to the community. 1. Introduction We present the newest version of Gemma open language models (Gemma Team, 2024a), codesigned with the family of Gemini frontier models (Gemini Team, 2023). This new version comes in sizes comparable to Gemma 2 (Gemma Team, 2024b), with the addition of a 1B model. These models are designed to run on standard consumer-grade hardware such as phones, laptops, and high-end GPUs. This version comes with several new abilities to the Gemma family; namely, multimodality, long context, and multilinguality, while preserving or surpassing the performance of prior versions. In terms of multimodality, most Gemma 3 models are compatible with a tailored version of the SigLIP vision encoder (Zhai et al., 2023). The language models treat images as a sequence of soft tokens encoded by SigLIP. We reduce the inference cost of image processing by condensing the vision embeddings into a fixed size of 256 vectors. The encoder works at a fixed resolution and we take inspiration from LLaVA (Liu et al., 2024) to enable flexible resolutions with a Pan and Scan (P&S) method. The second main architectural improvement is an increase in context size to 128K tokens, without reducing performance. A challenge with long context is the memory explosion of the KV cache during inference. To reduce this issue, we interleave multiple local layers between each globallayer, and assign a smaller span of only 1024 tokens to the local layers. Therefore, only the global layers attend to long context, and we have 1 global for every 5 local layers. The pre-training optimization recipe is similar to Gemma 2, with some modifications in the architecture design. We use the same tokenizer as Gemini 2.0, and we also revisit our data mixture to improve the multilingual capabilities of the models, while introducing image understanding. All Gemma 3 models are trained with knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015). In post-training, we focus our efforts on improving mathematics, reasoning, and chat abilities, as well as integrating the new capabilities of Gemma 3, long-context, and image inputs. We use a novel post-training approach that brings gains across all capabilities, including math, coding, chat, instruction following, and multilingual. The resulting Gemma 3 instruction-tuned models are both powerful and versatile, outperforming their predecessors by a wide margin. In the following sections, we provide a brief overview of our models, including the architecture and pre- and post-training recipes. We also provide detailed evaluations across a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative benchmarks. We discuss our approach to safe and responsible deployment and outline the broader implications of Gemma 3, its limitations, and advantages. 1See Contributions and Acknowledgments section for full author list. Please send correspondence to gemma-3-report@google.com. Gemma 3 Technical Report Figure 1|Example of visual interaction with Gemma 3 27B IT model. 2. Model Architecture Gemma 3 models follow the same general decoder-only transformer architecture as previous iterations (Vaswani et al., 2017), with most architecture elements similar to the first two Gemma versions. We use a Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) (Ainslie et al., 2023) with post-norm and pre-norm with RMSNorm (Zhang and Sennrich, 2019). Inspired by Dehghani et al. (2023), Wortsman et al. (2023) and Chameleon Team (2024), we replace the soft-capping of Gemma 2 with QK-norm. In this section, we focus on some key differences from previous versions below. 5:1 interleaving of local/global layers.

Our vocabulary has 256k entries. attention (Luong et al., 2015), with a pattern of 5 local layers for every global layer, starting with a local layer as the first layer of the model. Long context. Gemma 3 models support context length of 128K tokens, with the exception of the 1B model that has 32K. We increase RoPE base frequencyfrom10kto1Monglobalself-attention layers, and keep the frequency of the local layers at 10k. We follow a process similar to the positional interpolation of Chen et al. (2023) to extend the span of the global self-attention layers. 2.1. Vision modality Vision encoder. We use a 400M variant of the SigLIP encoder (Zhai et al., 2023), a Vision Transformer (Dosovitskiy, 2020) trained with a variation of the CLIP loss (Radford et al., 2021). The Gemma vision encoder takes as input square images resized to 896 x 896, and is finetuned on datafromvisualassistanttasks. Forsimplicity, we share the vision encoder across our 4B, 12B, and 27B models, keeping it frozen during training. Pan & Scan (P&S). The Gemma vision encoder operates at a fixed resolution of 896 ×896. This results in artifacts when processing non-square aspect ratios and high-resolution images, leading to unreadable text, or small objects disappearing. Weaddressthisissuewithanadaptivewindowing algorithm during inference. This algorithm segmentsimagesintonon-overlappingcropsofequal size, covering the whole image, and resize them to 896 ×896 pixels to pass them to the encoder. This windowing is applied only when necessary, and control for the maximum number of crops. It is an inference-time only optimization and can be disabled for faster inference.

Pre-training We follow a similar recipe as in Gemma 2 for pre-training with knowledge distillation. Training data. We pre-train our models on a slightly larger token budget than Gemma 2, i.e., we train on 14T tokens for Gemma 3 27B, 12T for the 12B version, 4T for the 4B, and 2T tokens for the 1B. The increase in tokens accounts for the mix of images and text used during pretraining. We also increase the amount of multilingual data to improve language coverage. We add both monolingual and parallel data, and we handle the imbalance in language representation using a strategy inspired by Chung et al. (2023). Tokenizer. We use the same tokenizer as Gemini 2.0: a SentencePiece tokenizer with split digits, preserved whitespace, and byte-level encodings (Kudo and Richardson, 2018). The resulting vocabulary has 262k entries. This tokenizer is more balanced for non-English languages. Filtering. We use filtering techniques that reduce the risk of unwanted or unsafe utterances and remove certain personal information and other sensitive data. We decontaminate evaluation sets from our pre-training data mixture, and reduce the risk of recitation by minimizing the proliferation of sensitive outputs. We also apply a quality reweighing step inspired by Sachdeva et al. (2024) to reduce occurrences of low quality data. Distillation. We sample 256 logits per token, weighted by teacher probabilities. The student learns the teacher’s distribution within these samples via cross-entropy loss. The teacher’s target distribution is set to zero probability for nonsampled logits, and renormalized.Raw (GB) Quantized (GB) Model bf16 Int4 Int4 blocks=32 SFP8 1B 2.0 0.5 0.7 1.0 +KV 2.9 1.4 1.6 1.9 4B 8.0 2.6 2.9 4.4 +KV 12.7 7.3 7.6 9.1 12B 24.0 6.6 7.1 12.4 +KV 38.9 21.5 22.0 27.3 27B 54.0 14.1 15.3 27.4 +KV 72.7 32.8 34.0 46.1 Table 3|Memory footprints (in GB) comparison between raw (bfloat16) and quantized checkpoints for weights and KV caching (+KV) at 32,768 context size, quantized in 8 bits. 2.3. Quantization Aware Training Along with the raw checkpoints, we also provide quantizedversionsofourmodelsindifferentstandardformats. Theseversionsareobtainedbyfinetuning each model for a small number of steps, typically 5,000, using Quantization Aware Training (QAT) (Jacob et al., 2018). We use probabilities from the non-quantized checkpoint as targets, and adapt the data to match the pretraining and post-training distributions. Based on the most popular open source quantization inference engines (e.g. llama.cpp), we focus on three weight representations: per-channel int4, per-block int4, and switched fp8. In Table 3, we report the memory filled by raw and quantized models for each weight representation with and without a KV-cache for a sequence of 32k tokens. 2.4. Compute Infrastructure We train our models with TPUv4, TPUv5e, and TPUv5p as outlined in Table 2. Each model configuration is optimized to minimize training step time. For the vision encoder, we pre-compute the embeddings for each image and directly train with the embeddings, adding no cost to the training of the language models. The optimizer state is sharded using an implementation of ZeRO-3 (Ren et al., 2021). For multi-pod training, we perform a data replica re- Gemma 3 Technical Report Context Formatting User turn <start_of_turn>user Model turn <start_of_turn>model End of turn <end_of_turn> Example of discussion: User: Who are you?

We use the ‘single controller’ programming paradigm of Jax (Roberts et al., 2023) and Pathways (Barham et al., 2022), along with the GSPMD partitioner (Xu et al., 2021) and the MegaScale XLA compiler (XLA, 2019). 3. Instruction-Tuning Pre-trained models are turned into instructiontuned models with an improved post-training approachcomparedtoourpriorrecipe(seeTable6). Techniques. Our post-training approach relies on an improved version of knowledge distillation (Agarwal et al., 2024; Anil et al., 2018; Hinton et al., 2015) from a large IT teacher, along withaRLfinetuningphasebasedonimprovedver- sionsofBOND(Sessaetal.,2024), WARM(Ramé et al., 2024b), and WARP (Ramé et al., 2024a). Reinforcement learning objectives. We use a variety of reward functions to improve helpfulness, math, coding, reasoning, instruction-following, and multilingual abilities, while minimizing model harmfulness. This includes learning from weight averaged reward models (Ramé et al., 2024b) trained with human feedback data, code execution feedback (Gehring et al., 2024), and ground-truth rewards for solving math problems (DeepSeek-AI, 2025; Lambert et al., 2024). Data filtering. We carefully optimize the data used in post-training to maximize model performance. We filter examples that show certain personal information, unsafe or toxic model outputs, mistaken self-identification data, and duplicated examples. Including subsets of data that encourage better in-context attribution, hedging, and refusals to minimize hallucinations also improves performance on factuality metrics, without degrading model performance on other metrics.

Please send correspondence to codegemma-team@google.com. This paper introduces CodeGemma, a collection of specialized open code models built on top of Gemma, capable of a variety of code and natural language generation tasks. We release three model variants. CodeGemma 7B pretrained (PT) and instruction-tuned (IT) variants have remarkably resilient natural language understanding, excel in mathematical reasoning, and match code capabilities of other open models. CodeGemma 2B is a state-of-the-art code completion model designed for fast code infilling and open-ended generation in latency-sensitive settings. Introduction We present CodeGemma, a collection of open code models based on Google DeepMind’s Gemma models (Gemma Team et al., 2024). Continuing from Gemma pretrained models, CodeGemma models are further trained on more than 500 to 1000 billion tokens of primarily code, usingthesamearchitecturesastheGemmamodel family. As a result, CodeGemma models achieve state-of-the-art code performance in both completion and generation tasks, while maintaining strongunderstandingandreasoningskillsatscale.

Unless speed is critically important, we suggest v1.1 as it offers a well balanced quality improvement. In this report, we provide an overview of the additions to Gemma, such as pretraining and instruction-tuning details for CodeGemma, followed by evaluations of all models across a wide variety of academic and real world tasks against similar models.

2024-8-29 RecurrentGemma: Moving Past Transformers for Efficient Open Language Models Griffin1, RLHF1and Gemma Teams1 1Google DeepMind. Please see contributors and acknowledgements section for full author list. We introduce RecurrentGemma, a family of open language models which uses Google’s novel Griffin architecture. Griffin combines linear recurrences with local attention to achieve excellent performance onlanguage. Ithasafixed-sizedstate, whichreducesmemoryuseandenablesefficientinferenceonlong sequences. We provide two sizes of models, containing 2B and 9B parameters, and provide pre-trained and instruction tuned variants for both. Our models achieve comparable performance to similarly-sized Gemma baselines despite being trained on fewer tokens. Introduction WepresentRecurrentGemma,afamilyofopenmodelsbased on the Griffin architecture (De et al., 2024). This architecture eschews global attention, instead modelling the sequence through a mixture of linear recurrences (Gu et al., 2021;Orvietoetal.,2023)andlocalattention(Beltagyetal., 2020). We provide two sizes of RecurrentGemma, with 2B and 9B parameters, both trained on 2T tokens. Our models achievesuperbperformanceonarangeofdownstreamtasks, competitive with the Gemma models (Gemma Team, 2024), an open transformer model family based on insights from Gemini (Gemini Team, 2023). To perform inference, transformers must retrieve the KV cache and load it into device memory. This KV cache grows linearly with sequence length. Although one can reduce the cachesizebyusinglocalattention(Beltagyetal.,2020),this comes at the cost of reduced performance. In contrast, Re- currentGemma compresses input sequences into a fixed-size state without sacrificing performance. This reduces memory use and enables efficient inference on long sequences. We verify below that RecurrentGemma models achieve faster inference than Gemma models. For each model size, we are releasing both a pre-trained checkpoint and an instruction tuned checkpoint fine-tuned for instruction-following and dialogue.1We are also releasing efficient JAX code to evaluate and fine-tune our models (Bradbury et al., 2018), including a specialized Pallas kernel to perform the linear recurrence on TPUs. We provide a reference PyTorch implementation as well. Model architecture We make only a single modification to the Griffin architecture (De et al., 2024), which is to multiply the input embeddings by a constant equal to the square root of model width. The input and output embeddings are tied, but this factor is not applied to the output. A similar multiplicative factor appears in Gemma (Gemma Team, 2024). We define the key model hyper-parameters for both RecurrentGemma-2B (De et al., 2024) for model definition.

(2024) for exact details on the overall architecture. Note that we do not apply weight decay to the parameters of the recurrent (RG-LRU) layers during training. Additionally when backpropagating through the square root operation in the recurrent layers, we always clip the derivative to a maximum value of 1000 for stability. Training details Pre-training We train on sequences of 8192 tokens. We use the same pre-training data as the Gemma models, which comprises primarily English data from web documents, mathematics and code. This dataset was filtered to reduce the risk of unwanted or unsafe utterances, and to filter out personal or sensitive data as well as to filter out all evaluation sets from our pre-training dataset. We refer to the Gemma report for more details (Gemma Team, 2024). We pre-train both RecurrentGemma-2B and RecurrentGemma-9B on 2T tokens. Note that in contrast, Gemma-2B was pre-trained on 3T tokens and Gemma-7B was pre-trained on 6T tokens. Like Gemma, we first train Corresponding author(s): [botev, sohamde, slsmith, anushanf]@google.com RecurrentGemma: Moving Past Transformers for Efficient Open Language Models Table 2|Academic benchmark results, compared to the Gemma models.

Like Gemma, we use a subset of the SentencePiece tokenizer (Kudo and Richardson, 2018), with a vocabulary size of 256k tokens. Note that, as a consequence of this large vocabulary size, the embedding layer comprises a significant fraction of the total model parameters, as shown in Table 1.Instruction tuning and RLHF We follow a similar instruction tuning approach to Gemma (Gemma Team, 2024), including a novel RLHF algorithm to fine-tune the model to output responses with high reward. Our instruction tuned model is trained to obey a specific dialogue format, which is defined in Table 3. For clarity, we give a concrete example in Table 4. Evaluation We evaluate RecurrentGemma across a broad range of domains, using a combination of automated benchmarks and human evaluation. Automated Benchmarks We report the performance of RecurrentGemma on a range of popular downstream evaluations in Table 2. RecurrentGemma-2B achieves comparable performance to Gemma-2B, even though Gemma-2B was trained on 50 % more tokens. RecurrentGemma-9B achieves comparable performance to Gemma-7B, even though Gemma-7B was trained on 3×more tokens. Note that RecurrentGemma- 9B has a similar number of total parameters as Gemma-7B (after accounting for embedding layers). Human Evaluation We sent our two final instruction tuned RecurrentGemma models (2B IT and 9B IT) for human evaluation studies RecurrentGemma: Moving Past Transformers for Efficient Open Language Models (a) Throughput comparison between Gemma-2B and RecurrentGemma-2B on a single TPUv5e. (b) Throughput comparison between Gemma-7B and RecurrentGemma-9B on a single TPUv4. Figure 1|Maximum tokens per second generated, when sampling sequences of different lengths from a prompt of 2K tokens, and when processing prompts of different lengths to generate the initial state from which to sample, for the RecurrentGemma 2B and 9B models. Both RecurrentGemma models achieve substantially higher sampling throughput than their Gemma counterpart, especially when generating long sequences. A much higher throughput can be achieved when processing input prompts compared to when generating samples, since prompt processing can be efficiently parallelized. RecurrentGemma and Gemma achieve similar prompt processing speeds at both model sizes.

As shown in Table 5, on a held-out collection of around 1000 prompts oriented toward asking models to follow instructions across creative writing and coding tasks, RecurrentGemma-2B IT achieves a 43.7% win rate against the larger Mistral 7B model, while RecurrentGemma-9B IT achieves a 59.3% win rate against the Mistral 7B model. On a held-out collection of around 400 prompts oriented towards testing basic safety protocols, RecurrentGemma- 2B IT achieved a 59.8% win rate against Mistral 7B v0.2 Instruct model, while RecurrentGemma-9B IT achieved a 59.9% win rate against Mistral 7B v0.2 Instruct. Inference Speed Benchmarks A key advantage of RecurrentGemma is that it has a significantly smaller state size than transformers on long sequences. Whereas Gemma’s KV cache grows proportional to sequence length, RecurrentGemma’s state is bounded, and does not increase on sequences longer than the local attention window size of 2K tokens. Inference is typically a memory-bound process for language models (De et al.,2024). Consequently, while the longest sample that can be generated autoregressively by Gemma is limited by the memory available on the host, RecurrentGemma can generate sequences of arbitrary length. Furthermore, the reduced memory requirement also enables RecurrentGemma to perform inference at much larger batch sizes, which amortizes the cost of loading model parameters from host memory into device memory. In Figures 1a and 1b, we compare the inference throughput achieved by the RecurrentGemma 2B and 9B models to thesimilarly-sizedGemmamodels. Wefirstplotthethroughput achieved when sampling from a prompt of 2K tokens for arangeofgenerationlengths. Thethroughputcalculatesthe maximum number of tokens we can sample per second on a single TPUv5e device (in the case of RecurrentGemma-2B) or a single TPUv4 device (in the case of RecurrentGemma- 9B). Note that in this plot, we do not account for the time required to process the prompt or the time required to converttheoutputsequencefromalistoftokenidsintothefinal text string. RecurrentGemma achieves higher throughput at all sequence lengths considered. The throughput achieved by RecurrentGemma does not reduce as the sequence length increases, while the throughput achieved by Gemma falls as the cache grows. RecurrentGemma-9B achieves particularly large (up to two orders of magnitude) improvements over Gemma-7B as shown in Figure 1b. We note that this is primarily due to Gemma-7B using Multi-Head Attention, whereas Gemma-2B uses Multi-Query Attention. For completeness, we also show the throughput achieved when processing input prompts of different lengths. Unlike auto-regressive sampling, the prompt is processed in parallel. Gemma and RecurrentGemma process input prompts at similar speeds. When processing the prompt, both Gemma and RecurrentGemma achieve throughput of roughly 40K tokenspersecondforthe2Bmodelsandroughly12Ktokens per second for the 9B model. By contrast, when sampling, RecurrentGemma achieves throughput of 6K tokens per second, with Gemma substantially slower. Thus, sampling will dominate the total time required, unless the prompt is significantly longer than the desired sample.

We perform inference for Gemma using a modified version of Gemma’s Flax implementation, which we optimized further to improve performance. Responsible Deployment We follow the same safety mitigations as described in the Gemma release (Gemma Team, 2024). We evaluated our models on standard academic safety benchmarks, as shown in Table 6, and our final models were also subjected to ethicsandsafetyevaluationsbyanindependentteambefore release. However, our testing cannot cover all possible use casesofRecurrentGemma, andthuswerecommendallusers of RecurrentGemma to conduct their own safety testing, specific to their use-case, prior to deployment. Conclusion RecurrentGemma offers the performance of Gemma, while achieving higher throughput during inference, especially on long sequences. We hope that RecurrentGemma will unlock novel applications of highly performant small language models in resource constrained environments.

LLaMA: Open and Efficient Foundation Language Models Hugo Touvron, Thibaut Lavril, Gautier Izacard, Xavier Martinet Marie-Anne Lachaux, Timothee Lacroix, Baptiste Rozière, Naman Goyal Eric Hambro, Faisal Azhar, Aurelien Rodriguez, Armand Joulin Edouard Grave, Guillaume Lample Meta AI Abstract We introduce LLaMA, a collection of foundation language models ranging from 7B to 65B parameters. We train our models on trillions of tokens, and show that it is possible to train state-of-the-art models using publicly available datasets exclusively, without resorting to proprietary and inaccessible datasets. In particular, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 (175B) on most benchmarks, and LLaMA- 65B is competitive with the best models, Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B. We release all our models to the research community1. 1 Introduction Large Languages Models (LLMs) trained on massive corpora of texts have shown their ability to perform new tasks from textual instructions or from a few examples (Brown et al., 2020). These few-shot properties first appeared when scaling models to a sufficient size (Kaplan et al., 2020), resulting in a line of work that focuses on further scaling these models (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021). These efforts are based on the assumption that more parameters will lead to better performance. However, recent work from Hoffmann et al. (2022) shows that, for a given compute budget, the best performances are not achieved by the largest models, but by smaller models trained on more data. The objective of the scaling laws from Hoffmann et al. (2022) is to determine how to best scale the dataset and model sizes for a particular training compute budget. However, this objective disregards the inference budget, which becomes critical when serving a language model at scale. In this context, given a target level of performance, the preferred model is not the fastest to train but the fastest at inference, and although it may be cheaper to train a large model to reach a certain level of Equal contribution. Correspondence: {htouvron, thibautlav,gizacard,egrave,glample}@meta.com ultimately be cheaper at inference. For instance, although Hoffmann et al. (2022) recommends training a 10B model on 200B tokens, we find that the performance of a 7B model continues to improve even after 1T tokens. The focus of this work is to train a series of language models that achieve the best possible performance at various inference budgets, by training on more tokens than what is typically used. The resulting models, called LLaMA, ranges from 7B to 65B parameters with competitive performance compared to the best existing LLMs. For instance, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 on most benchmarks, despite being 10 smaller. We believe that this model will help democratize the access and study of LLMs, since it can be run on a single GPU. At the higher-end of the scale, our 65B-parameter model is also competitive with the best large language models such as Chinchilla or PaLM-540B. Unlike Chinchilla, PaLM, or GPT-3, we only use publicly available data, making our work compatible with open-sourcing, while most existing models rely on data which is either not publicly available or undocumented (e.g. “Books – 2TB” or “Social media conversations”). There exist some exceptions, notably OPT (Zhang et al., 2022), GPT-NeoX (Black et al., 2022), BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022) and GLM (Zeng et al., 2022), but none that are competitive with PaLM-62B or Chinchilla. In the rest of this paper, we present an overview of the modifications we made to the transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), as well as our training method. We then report the performance of our models and compare with others LLMs on a set of standard benchmarks. Finally, we expose some of the biases and toxicity encoded in our models, using some of the most recent benchmarks from 2 Approach Our training approach is similar to the methods described in previous work (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022), and is inspired by the Chinchilla scaling laws (Hoffmann et al., 2022). We train large transformers on a large quantity of textual data using a standard optimizer. 2.1 Pre-training Data Our training dataset is a mixture of several sources, reported in Table 1, that cover a diverse set of domains. For the most part, we reuse data sources that have been leveraged to train other LLMs, with the restriction of only using data that is publicly available, and compatible with open sourcing. This leads to the following mixture of data and the percentage they represent in the training set: English CommonCrawl [67%]. We preprocess five CommonCrawl dumps, ranging from 2017 to 2020, with the CCNet pipeline (Wenzek et al., 2020). This process deduplicates the data at the line level, performs language identification with a fastText linear classifier to remove non-English pages and filters low quality content with an n- gram language model. In addition, we trained a linear model to classify pages used as references in Wikipedia v.s.randomly sampled pages, and discarded pages not classified as references. C4 [15%]. During exploratory experiments, we observed that using diverse pre-processed Com- monCrawl datasets improves performance. We thus included the publicly available C4 dataset (Raffel et al., 2020) in our data. The preprocessing of C4 also contains deduplication and language identification steps: the main difference with CCNet is the quality filtering, which mostly relies on heuristics such as presence of punctuation marks or the number of words and sentences in a webpage. Github [4.5%]. We use the public GitHub dataset available on Google BigQuery. We only kept projects that are distributed under the Apache, BSD and MIT licenses. Additionally, we filtered low quality files with heuristics based on the line length or proportion of alphanumeric characters, and removed boilerplate, such as headers, with regular expressions. Finally, we deduplicate the resulting dataset at the file level, with exact matches. Wikipedia [4.5%]. We add Wikipedia dumps from the June-August 2022 period, covering 20Dataset Sampling prop.

The Llama 3 Herd of Models Llama Team, AI @ Meta1 1A detailed contributor list can be found in the appendix of this paper. Modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems are powered by foundation models. This paper presents a new set of foundation models, called Llama 3. It is a herd of language models that natively support multilinguality, coding, reasoning, and tool usage. Our largest model is a dense Transformer with 405B parameters and a context window of up to 128K tokens. This paper presents an extensive empirical evaluation of Llama 3. We find that Llama 3 delivers comparable quality to leading language models such as GPT-4 on a plethora of tasks. We publicly release Llama 3, including pre-trained and post-trained versions of the 405B parameter language model and our Llama Guard 3 model for input and output safety. The paper also presents the results of experiments in which we integrate image, video, and speech capabilities into Llama 3 via a compositional approach. We observe this approach performs competitively with the state-of-the-art on image, video, and speech recognition tasks. The resulting models are not yet being broadly released as they are still under development. Date:July 23, 2024 1 Introduction Foundation models are general models of language, vision, speech, and/or other modalities that are designed to support a large variety of AI tasks. They form the basis of many modern AI systems. The development of modern foundation models consists of two main stages: (1)a pre-training stage in which the model is trained at massive scale using straightforward tasks such as next-word prediction or captioning and(2)a post-training stage in which the model is tuned to follow instructions, align with human preferences, and improve specific capabilities (for example, coding and reasoning). In this paper, we present a new set of foundation models for language, called Llama 3. The Llama 3 Herd of models natively supports multilinguality, coding, reasoning, and tool usage. Our largest model is dense Transformer with 405B parameters, processing information in a context window of up to 128K tokens. Each member of the herd is listed in Table 1. All the results presented in this paper are for the Llama 3.1 models, which we will refer to as Llama 3 throughout for brevity. We believe there are three key levers in the development of high-quality foundation models: data, scale, and managing complexity. We seek to optimize for these three levers in our development process: •Data.Compared to prior versions of Llama (Touvron et al., 2023a,b), we improved both the quantity and qualityofthedataweuseforpre-trainingandpost-training. Theseimprovementsincludethedevelopment of more careful pre-processing and curation pipelines for pre-training data and the development of more rigorous quality assurance and filtering approaches for post-training data. We pre-train Llama 3 on a corpus of about 15T multilingual tokens, compared to 1.8T tokens for Llama 2. •Scale.We train a model at far larger scale than previous Llama models: our flagship language model was pre-trained using 3.8×1025FLOPs, almost 50×more than the largest version of Llama 2. Specifically, we pre-trained a flagship model with 405B trainable parameters on 15.6T text tokens.

Mistral 7B Albert Q. Jiang, Alexandre Sablayrolles, Arthur Mensch, Chris Bamford, Devendra Singh Chaplot, Diego de las Casas, Florian Bressand, Gianna Lengyel, Guillaume Lample, Lucile Saulnier, Lélio Renard Lavaud, Marie-Anne Lachaux, Pierre Stock, Teven Le Scao, Thibaut Lavril, Thomas Wang, Timothée Lacroix, William El Sayed Abstract We introduce Mistral 7B, a 7–billion-parameter language model engineered for superior performance and efficiency. Mistral 7B outperforms the best open 13B model (Llama 2) across all evaluated benchmarks, and the best released 34B model (Llama 1) in reasoning, mathematics, and code generation. Our model leverages grouped-query attention (GQA) for faster inference, coupled with sliding window attention (SWA) to effectively handle sequences of arbitrary length with a reduced inference cost. We also provide a model fine-tuned to follow instructions, Mistral 7B – Instruct, that surpasses Llama 2 13B – chat model both on human and automated benchmarks. Our models are released under the Apache 2.0 license. 1 Introduction In the rapidly evolving domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP), the race towards higher model performance often necessitates an escalation in model size. However, this scaling tends to increase computational costs and inference latency, thereby raising barriers to deployment in practical, real-world scenarios. In this context, the search for balanced models delivering both high-level performance and efficiency becomes critically essential. Our model, Mistral 7B, demonstrates that a carefully designed language model can deliver high performance while maintaining an efficient inference. Mistral 7B outperforms the previous best 13B model (Llama 2, [ 26]) across all tested benchmarks, and surpasses the best 34B model (LLaMa 34B, [ 25]) in mathematics and code generation. Furthermore, Mistral 7B approaches the coding performance of Code-Llama 7B [ 20], without sacrificing performance on non-code related benchmarks. Mistral 7B leverages grouped-query attention (GQA) [ 1], and sliding window attention (SWA) [ 6,3]. GQA significantly accelerates the inference speed, and also reduces the memory requirement during decoding, allowing for higher batch sizes hence higher throughput, a crucial factor for real-time applications. In addition, SWA is designed to handle longer sequences more effectively at a reduced computational cost, thereby alleviating a common limitation in LLMs. These attention mechanisms collectively contribute to the enhanced performance and efficiency of Mistral 7B.arXiv:2310.06825v1 [cs.CL] 10 Oct 2023 Mistral 7B is released under the Apache 2.0 license. This release is accompanied by a reference implementation1facilitating easy deployment either locally or on cloud platforms such as AWS, GCP, or Azure using the vLLM [ 17] inference server and SkyPilot2. Integration with Hugging Face3is also streamlined for easier integration. Moreover, Mistral 7B is crafted for ease of fine-tuning across a myriad of tasks. As a demonstration of its adaptability and superior performance, we present a chat model fine-tuned from Mistral 7B that significantly outperforms the Llama 2 13B – Chat model. Mistral 7B takes a significant step in balancing the goals of getting high performance while keeping large language models efficient. Through our work, our aim is to help the community create more affordable, efficient, and high-performing language models that can be used in a wide range of real-world applications. 2 Architectural details

Mixtral of Experts Albert Q. Jiang, Alexandre Sablayrolles, Antoine Roux, Arthur Mensch, Blanche Savary, Chris Bamford, Devendra Singh Chaplot, Diego de las Casas, Emma Bou Hanna, Florian Bressand, Gianna Lengyel, Guillaume Bour, Guillaume Lample, Lélio Renard Lavaud, Lucile Saulnier, Marie-Anne Lachaux, Pierre Stock, Sandeep Subramanian, Sophia Yang, Szymon Antoniak, Teven Le Scao, Théophile Gervet, Thibaut Lavril, Thomas Wang, Timothée Lacroix, William El Sayed Abstract We introduce Mixtral 8x7B, a Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) language model. Mixtral has the same architecture as Mistral 7B, with the difference that each layer is composed of 8 feedforward blocks (i.e. experts). For every token, at each layer, a router network selects two experts to process the current state and combine their outputs. Even though each token only sees two experts, the selected experts can be different at each timestep. As a result, each token has access to 47B parameters, but only uses 13B active parameters during inference. Mixtral was trained with a context size of 32k tokens and it outperforms or matches Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 across all evaluated benchmarks. In particular, Mixtral vastly outperforms Llama 2 70B on mathematics, code generation, and multilingual benchmarks. We also provide a model finetuned to follow instructions, Mixtral 8x7B – Instruct, that surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B – chat model on human benchmarks. Both the base and instruct models are released under the Apache 2.0 license. 1 Introduction In this paper, we present Mixtral 8x7B, a sparse mixture of experts model (SMoE) with open weights, licensed under Apache 2.0. Mixtral outperforms Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 on most benchmarks. As it only uses a subset of its parameters for every token, Mixtral allows faster inference speed at low batch-sizes, and higher throughput at large batch-sizes. Mixtral is a sparse mixture-of-experts network. It is a decoder-only model where the feedforward block picks from a set of 8 distinct groups of parameters. At every layer, for every token, a router network chooses two of these groups (the “experts”) to process the token and combine their output additively. This technique increases the number of parameters of a model while controlling cost and latency, as the model only uses a fraction of the total set of parameters per token. Mixtral is pretrained with multilingual data using a context size of 32k tokens. It either matches or exceeds the performance of Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5, over several benchmarks.

Nemotron-4 340B Technical Report NVIDIA Abstract We release the Nemotron-4 340B model family, including Nemotron-4-340B-Base, Nemotron-4- 340B-Instruct, and Nemotron-4-340B-Reward. Our models are open access under the NVIDIA Open Model License Agreement, a permissive model license that allows distribution, modification, and use of the models and its outputs. These models perform competitively to open access models on a wide range of evaluation benchmarks, and were sized to fit on a single DGX H100 with 8 GPUs when deployed in FP8 precision. We believe that the community can benefit from these models in various research studies and commercial applications, especially for generating synthetic data to train smaller language models. Notably, over 98% of data used in our model alignment process is synthetically generated, showcasing the effectiveness of these models in generating synthetic data. To further support open research and facilitate model development, we are also open-sourcing the synthetic data generation pipeline used in our model alignment process. Models: Nemotron-4-340B-Base, Nemotron-4-340B-Instruct, Nemotron-4-340B-Reward. Code: Pretraining, Alignment and Reward Model Training. Webpage: Nemotron-4 340B Announcement. 1 Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) are highly effective at many tasks in diverse applications. Recent efforts have focused on increasing the accuracy of these models by pretraining on more, higher-quality tokens. For example, the Llama-2 family (Touvron et al., 2023) was trained on 2 trillion tokens while the Llama-3 family (MetaAI, 2024) was trained on 15 trillion tokens. The Nemotron-4 340B base model was trained with 9 trillion tokens from a high-quality dataset, the details of which are provided in Parmar et al. (2024). We align the base LLM with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), followed by Preference Fine-Tuning such as Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) (Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2024). The alignment process enables the model to follow instructions better, engage in conversations effectively, and better solve problems. The alignment process relies on a reward model that can accurately identify the quality of responses. This reward model is a crucial component in RLHF and also a useful tool for quality filtering and preference ranking in synthetic data generation. To support the ongoing development of LLMs across the community, we introduce Nemotron-4-340B-Base, Nemotron-4-340B-Instruct, and Nemotron-4-340B-Reward, which are released as open access models with a permissive license. Figure 1 highlights the accuracy of the Nemotron-4 340B model family across selected tasks.

NVLM: Open Frontier-Class Multimodal LLMs Wenliang Dai∗Nayeon Lee∗Boxin Wang∗Zhuolin Yang∗ Zihan Liu Jon Barker Tuomas Rintamaki Mohammad Shoeybi Bryan Catanzaro Wei Ping∗,† NVIDIA ∗Equal contributions, ordered alphabetically {wdai, nayeonl, boxinw, zhuoliny, wping}@nvidia.com †Leads the effort. Abstract We introduce NVLM 1.0,1a family of frontier-class multimodal large language models (LLMs) that achieve state-of-the-art results on vision-language tasks, rivaling the leading proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-access models (e.g., Llama 3-V 405B and InternVL 2). Remarkably, NVLM 1.0 shows improved text-only performance over its LLM backbone after multimodal training. In terms of model design, we perform a comprehensive comparison between decoder-only multimodal LLMs (e.g., LLaV A) and cross-attention-based models (e.g., Flamingo). Based on the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches, we propose a novel architecture that enhances both training efficiency and multimodal reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we introduce a 1-D tile-tagging design for tile-based dynamic high-resolution images, which significantly boosts performance on multimodal reasoning and OCR-related tasks. Regarding training data, we meticulously curate and provide detailed information on our multimodal pretraining and supervised fine-tuning datasets. Our findings indicate that dataset quality and task diversity are more important than scale, even during the pretraining phase, across all architectures. Notably, we develop production-grade multimodality for the NVLM-1.0 models, enabling them to excel in vision-language tasks while maintaining and even improving text-only performance compared to their LLM backbones. To achieve this, we craft and integrate a high-quality text-only dataset into multimodal training, alongside a substantial amount of multimodal math and reasoning data, leading to enhanced math and coding capabilities across modalities. huggingface.co/nvidia/NVLM-D-72B and will open-source the training code for the community soon.

The main di erence between these three objects is their architecture and purpose. CPUs are designed for general-purpose computing and have a few cores optimized for sequential processing. GPUs, on the other hand, have many cores and are designed for parallel processing, making them ideal for tasks such as graphics rendering and deep learning. TPUs are specialized chips designed by Google speci cally for deep learning workloads, with a focus on high performance and energy e ciency.Explain why this meme is funny. The humor in this image comes from the visual representation of the common phrase "the abstract and the paper." The phrase is often used to describe the di erence between the summary of a research paper and the full paper itself. The image shows a large,  erce-looking lynx on the left, labeled "the abstract," and a small, domestic cat on the right, labeled "the paper." The contrast between the two animals is humorous because it visually represents the idea that the summary of a paper (the lynx) can be much more impressive or intimidating than the actual content of the paper (the cat).What is the di erence between the left, middle and right object in the image? You are a helpful driving assistant. In this scene, which lane should I choose and why? In this scene, you should choose the right lane. The signs indicate that the left two lanes are closed, while the right lane is open for buses and RVs. This suggests that the right lane is the only available option for vehicles, including buses and RVs. According to the table, explain which food is the most likely cause of the outbreak of food poisoning? The table shows the number of people who ate a certain food and the number of people who ate the food and got sick. The food that is the most likely cause of the outbreak of food poisoning is the one with the highest percentage of people who ate it and got sick. To calculate the percentage, divide the number of people who ate the food and got sick by the total number of people who ate the food, and then multiply by 100. For example, for cold chicken: (34/86) x 100 = 39.5% For potato salad: (38/54) x 100 = 70.4% For egg sandwiches: (40/76) x 100 = 52.6% For fruit pie and cream: (12/32) x 100 = 37.5% For cheese: (12/48) x 100 = 25% Therefore, the food that is the most likely cause of the outbreak of food poisoning is potato salad, with 70.4% of people who ate it getting sick. The pseudo code in the image describes the selection sort algorithm. The code for the same is as follows: def selection_sort(arr): n = len(arr) for i in range(n): min_index = i for j in range(i+1, n): if arr[j] < arr[min_index]: min_index = j arr[i], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[i] return arrWrite code based on the provided pseudo code. What percentage of market share does NVIDIA have for data center GPUs in 2023? NVIDIA has 92% of the market share for data center GPUs in 2023. Provide short description of middle pie chart. The middle pie chart shows the market share of leading vendors in the Generative AI market for the year 2023. The chart shows that OpenAI has the largest market share at 39%, followed by Microsoft at 30%. AWS and Google have 8% and 7% market share respectively. The remaining 16% of the market is held by other vendors. (b) (a) (c)(d) (e) (f)

The release of the Llama series (Touvron et al., 2023) has further ignited interests within the open-source community, particularly regarding GPT-level local LLMs. Recently, Claude-3 Opus (Anthropic, 2024) and GPT-4o (omni) (OpenAI, 2024), the updated model for ChatGPT, have ascended to the pinnacle of the Chatbot Arena (Chiang et al., 2024) in quick succession. This platform is well-regarded for its human evaluations of LLMs. Moreover, Llama- 3 (AI@Meta, 2024) has emerged as the state-of-the-art open-weight model series, narrowing the performance gap with leading proprietary models and widely acknowledged as GPT-4–level. An increasing number of competitive LLMs are now pursuing advancements similar to those made by the GPT series from OpenAI. Many of these models, including Qwen (Bai et al., 2023a), Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023a), Gemma (Mesnard et al., 2024), etc., have been released in an open-weight manner. Over recent months, we have successively introduced the Qwen series (Bai et al., 2023a) and progressed to Qwen1.5 (Qwen Team, 2024a). In the meantime, we have unveiled the vision-language model Qwen-VL (Bai et al., 2023b), and launched the audio-language model Qwen-Audio (Chu et al., 2023). In this work, we introduce the newest addition to the Qwen family of large language models and large multimodal modles: Qwen2. Qwen2 is a series of LLMs, grounded in the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), trained using next-token prediction. The model series encompasses foundational, i.e., base language models, pre-trained but unaligned to human preferences, and instruction-tuned models, fine-tuned with single-turn and multi-turn instructionfollowing datasets suitable for chat and agent purposes. Our release comprises four dense models with parameter counts of 0.5 billion, 1.5 billion, 7 billion, and 72 billion, plus a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with 57 billion parameters, of which 14 billion are activated for each token. The smaller models, specifically Qwen2-0.5B and Qwen2-1.5B, are designed for easy deployment on portable devices such as smartphones, earphones, and smart glasses. Conversely, the larger models cater to deployment across GPUs of varying scales. All models were pre-trained on a high-quality, large-scale dataset comprising over 7 trillion tokens, covering a wide range of domains and languages. Compared to previous editions of Qwen, Qwen2 includes a broader spectrum of linguistic data, enhancing the quantity and quality of code and mathematics content. This enrichment is hypothesized to improve reasoning abilities of LLMs. Regarding post-training, all models underwent supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization (DPO, Rafailov et al., 2023), aligning them with human preferences through learning from human feedback. This process endows the models with the capability to follow instructions effectively. We have conducted a thorough evaluation of Qwen2, alongside a selection of baseline models including both open-weight and proprietary models accessible via API. Qwen2 outperforms competing models in evaluations of both fundamental language capabilities and instruction-tuned functionalities Specifically, Qwen2-72B-Instruct, our instruction-tuned variant, scores 9.1 on MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2023), 48.1 on Arena-Hard (Chiang et al., 2024), and 35.7 on LiveCodeBench (Jain et al., 2024). Meanwhile, Qwen2-72B, the base language model, achieves 84.2 on MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021a), 37.9 on GPQA (Rein et al., 2023), 64.6 on HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021), 89.5 on GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), and 82.4 on BBH (Suzgun et al., 2023). 2 T OKENIZER & M ODEL This section introduces the tokenizer and model design of Qwen2. We detail the model architecture and configurations for different model sizes. 2.1 T OKENIZER Following Qwen (Bai et al., 2023a), we employ the identical tokenizer based on byte-level bytepair encoding. Notably, this tokenizer exhibits high encoding efficiency, as evidenced by its better compression rate relative to alternatives, facilitating the multilingual capabilities of Qwen2. Models of all sizes employ a common vocabulary consisting of 151,643 regular tokens and 3 control tokens. For more information, please refer to Bai et al. (2023a). It should be noted that, owing to considerations in distributed training, the effective size for the embeddings is larger. 2.2 M ODEL ARCHITECTURE The Qwen2 series fundamentally constitute large language models based on the Transformer architecture, featuring self-attention with causal masks (Vaswani et al., 2017). Specifically, this series encompasses dense language models of 4 scales and a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model. We introduce the specifics of the dense models before delving into the MoE model’s distinctive attributes. 2.2.1 Q WEN 2 D ENSE MODEL The architecture of the Qwen2 dense models comprises multiple Transformer layers, each equipped with causal attention mechanisms and feed-forward neural networks (FFNs). Key differences from Qwen are described below: Grouped Query Attention We adopt Grouped Query Attention (GQA, Ainslie et al., 2023) instead of conventional multi-head attention (MHA). GQA optimizes KV cache usage during inference, significantly enhancing throughput. Detailed KV head configurations for various model sizes are reported in Section 2.2.3. Dual Chunk Attention with YARN To expand the context window of Qwen2, we implement Dual Chunk Attention (DCA, An et al., 2024), which segments long sequences into chunks of manageable lengths. If the input can be handled in a chunk, DCA produces the same result as the original attention. Otherwise, DCA facilitates effective capture of relative positional information between tokens within and across chunks, thereby improving long context performance. Moreover, we also employ YARN (Peng et al., 2023) to rescale the attention weights for better length extrapolation. Moreover, we follow Qwen with the usage of SwiGLU (Dauphin et al., 2017) for activation, Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE, Su et al., 2024) for positional embedding, QKV bias (Su, 2023) for attention, RMSNorm (Jiang et al., 2023b) and pre-normalization for training stability. 2.2.2 Q WEN 2 M IXTURE -OF-EXPERTS MODEL The architecture of Qwen2 MoE models closely mirrors that of Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B (Qwen Team, 2024c). As a substitute for the original FFN, the MoE FFN consists of nindividual FFNs, each serving as an expert. Each token is directed to a specific expert Eifor computation based on probabilities assigned by a gated network G: p= softmax (G(x)), (1) y=X i∈topk(p)piEi(x). (2) In the following, we present critical design considerations of Qwen2 MoE. Expert Granularity The key structural difference between MoE models and dense models is that MoE layers incorporate multiple FFNs, each serving as an individual expert. Consequently, one straightforward strategy to transition from a dense architecture to an MoE architecture is to set the parameters of each expert equal to those of a single FFN from the original dense model. For example, transitioning from Mistral-7B (Jiang et al., 2023a) to Mixtral 8x7B (Jiang et al., 2024), involves activating two of the eight experts at a time. Differently, our model employs fine-grained experts (Dai et al., 2024), creating smaller-scale experts while activating a greater number of experts simultaneously. Given an equal total number of expert parameters and activated parameters, finegrained experts offer a richer set of expert combinations. By leveraging these fine-grained experts, Qwen2 MoE facilitates more diverse and dynamic expert utilization, thereby enhancing overall performance and adaptability. Expert Routing The design of expert routing mechanisms is crucial for enhancing the performance of MoE models. Recently, there has been a notable trend towards integrating both shared and routing-specific experts within MoE layers (Rajbhandari et al., 2022; Dai et al., 2024). We adopt this approach, as it facilitates the application of shared experts across various tasks while reserving others for selective use in specific routing scenarios. The introduction of shared and specialized experts offers a more adaptable and efficient method for developing MoE routing mechanisms.

2025-01-06 Qwen2.5 Technical Report Qwen Team Abstract In this report, we introduce Qwen2.5, a comprehensive series of large language models (LLMs) designed to meet diverse needs. Compared to previous iterations, Qwen 2.5 has been significantly improved during both the pre-training and post-training stages. In terms of pre-training, we have scaled the high-quality pre-training datasets from the previous 7 trillion tokens to 18 trillion tokens. This provides a strong foundation for common sense, expert knowledge, and reasoning capabilities. In terms of post-training, we implement intricate supervised finetuning with over 1 million samples, as well as multistage reinforcement learning, including offline learning DPO and online learning GRPO. Post-training techniques significantly enhance human preference, and notably improve long text generation, structural data analysis, and instruction following. To handle diverse and varied use cases effectively, we present Qwen2.5 LLM series in rich configurations. The open-weight offerings include base models and instruction-tuned models in sizes of 0.5B, 1.5B, 3B, 7B, 14B, 32B, and 72B parameters. Quantized versions of the instruction-tuned models are also provided. Over 100 models can be accessed from Hugging Face Hub, ModelScope, and Kaggle.

March 5, 2025 Qwen2.5-VL Technical Report Qwen Team, Alibaba Group Abstract We introduce Qwen2.5-VL, the latest flagship model of Qwen vision-language series, which demonstrates significant advancements in both foundational capabilities and innovative functionalities. Qwen2.5-VL achieves a major leap forward in understanding and interacting with the world through enhanced visual recognition, precise object localization, robust document parsing, and long-video comprehension. A standout feature of Qwen2.5-VL is its ability to localize objects using bounding boxes or points accurately. It provides robust structured data extraction from invoices, forms, and tables, as well as detailed analysis of charts, diagrams, and layouts. To handle complex inputs, Qwen2.5- VL introduces dynamic resolution processing and absolute time encoding, enabling it to process images of varying sizes and videos of extended durations (up to hours) with second-level event localization. This allows the model to natively perceive spatial scales and temporal dynamics without relying on traditional normalization techniques. By training a native dynamic-resolution Vision Transformer (ViT) from scratch and incorporating Window Attention, we have significantly reduced computational overhead while maintaining native resolution. As a result, Qwen2.5-VL excels not only in static image and document understanding but also as an interactive visual agent capable of reasoning, tool usage, and task execution in real-world scenarios such as operating computers and mobile devices. The model achieves strong generalization across domains without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Qwen2.5-VL is available in three sizes, addressing diverse use cases from edge AI to high-performance computing. The flagship Qwen2.5-VL-72B model matches state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, particularly excelling in document and diagram understanding. The smaller Qwen2.5-VL-7B and Qwen2.5-VL-3B models outperform comparable competitors, offering strong capabilities even in resource-constrained environments. Additionally, Qwen2.5-VL maintains robust linguistic performance, preserving the core language competencies of the Qwen2.5 LLM. 1 Introduction Large vision-language models (LVLMs) (OpenAI, 2024; Anthropic, 2024a; Team et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024f) represent a pivotal breakthrough in artificial intelligence, signaling a transformative approach to multimodal understanding and interaction. By seamlessly integrating visual perception with natural language processing, these advanced models are fundamentally reshaping how machines interpret and analyze complex information across diverse domains. Despite significant advancements in multimodal large language models, the current capabilities of these models can be likened to the middle layer of a sandwich cookie—competent across various tasks but falling short of exceptional performance. Finegrained visual tasks form the foundational layer of this analogy. In this iteration of Qwen2.5-VL, we are committed to exploring fine-grained perception capabilities, aiming to establish a robust foundation for LVLMs and create an agentic amplifier for real-world applications. The top layer of this framework is multi-modal reasoning, which is enhanced by leveraging the latest Qwen2.5 LLM and employing multi-modal QA data construction. A spectrum of works have promoted the development of multimodal large models, characterized by architectural design, visual input processing, and data curation. One of the primary drivers of progress in LVLMs is the continuous innovation in architecture. The studies presented in (Alayrac et al., 2022; Li et al., 2022a; 2023b; Liu et al., 2023b;a; Wang et al., 2024i; Zhang et al., 2024b; Wang et al., 2023) have incrementally shaped the current paradigm, which typically consists of a visual encoder, a cross-modal projector, and LLM. Fine-grained perception models have emerged as another crucial area. Models like (Xiao et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023c; Ren et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024a;d; Peng et al., 2023; Deitke et al., 2024) have pushed the boundaries of what is possible in terms of detailed visual understanding. The architectures of Omni (Li et al., 2024g; 2025b; Ye et al., 2024) and MoE (Riquelme et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024h;c; Wu et al., 2024b) also inspire the future evolution of LVLMs. Enhancements in visual encoders (Chen et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024b; Liang et al., 2025) and resolution scaling (Li et al., 2023c; Ye et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023a) have played a pivotal role in improving the quality of practical visual understanding. Curating data with more diverse scenarios and higher-quality is an essential step in training advanced LVLMs. The efforts proposed in (Guo et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024d; Liu et al., 2024a; Chen et al., 2024a; Tong et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024a) are highly valuable contributions to this endeavor. However, despite their remarkable progress, vision-language models currently face developmental bottlenecks, including computational complexity, limited contextual understanding, poor fine-grained visual perception, and inconsistent performance across varied sequence length. In this report, we introduce the latest work Qwen2.5-VL, which continues the open-source philosophy of the Qwen series, achieving and even surpassing top-tier closed-source models on various benchmarks. Technically, our contributions are four-folds: (1) We implement window attention in the visual encoder to optimize inference efficiency; (2) We introduce dynamic FPS sampling, extending dynamic resolution to the temporal dimension and enabling comprehensive video understanding across varied sampling rates; (3) We upgrade MRoPE in the temporal domain by aligning to absolute time, thereby facilitating more sophisticated temporal sequence learning; (4) We make significant efforts in curating high-quality data for both pre-training and supervised fine-tuning, further scaling the pre-training corpus from 1.2 trillion tokens to 4.1 trillion tokens. The sparkling characteristics of Qwen2.5-VL are as follows: •Powerful document parsing capabilities: Qwen2.5-VL upgrades text recognition to omnidocument parsing, excelling in processing multi-scene, multilingual, and various built-in (handwriting, tables, charts, chemical formulas, and music sheets) documents. •Precise object grounding across formats: Qwen2.5-VL unlocks improved accuracy in detecting, pointing, and counting objects, accommodating absolute coordinate and JSON formats for advanced spatial reasoning. •Ultra-long video understanding and fine-grained video grounding: Our model extends native dynamic resolution to the temporal dimension, enhancing the ability to understand videos lasting hours while extracting event segments in seconds. •Enhanced agent Functionality for computer and mobile devices: Leverage advanced grounding, reasoning, and decision-making abilities, boosting the model with superior agent functionality on smartphones and computers.

2025-03-27 Qwen2.5-Omni Technical Report Qwen Team Abstract In this report, we present Qwen2.5-Omni, an end-to-end multimodal model designed to perceive diverse modalities, including text, images, audio, and video, while simultaneously generating text and natural speech responses in a streaming manner. To enable the streaming of multimodal information inputs, both audio and visual encoders utilize a block-wise processing approach. This strategy effectively decouples the handling of long sequences of multimodal data, assigning the perceptual responsibilities to the multimodal encoder and entrusting the modeling of extended sequences to a large language model. Such a division of labor enhances the fusion of different modalities via the shared attention mechanism. To synchronize the timestamps of video inputs with audio, we organize the audio and video sequentially in an interleaved manner and propose a novel position embedding approach, named TMRoPE (Time-aligned Multimodal RoPE). To concurrently generate text and speech while avoiding interference between the two modalities, we propose Thinker-Talker architecture. In this framework, Thinker functions as a large language model tasked with text generation, while Talker is a dual-track autoregressive model that directly utilizes the hidden representations from the Thinker to produce audio tokens as output. Both the Thinker and Talker models are designed to be trained and inferred in an end-to-end manner. For decoding audio tokens in a streaming manner, we introduce a sliding-window DiT that restricts the receptive field, aiming to reduce the initial package delay. Qwen2.5-Omni is comparable with similarly sized Qwen2.5-VL and outperforms Qwen2-Audio. Furthermore, Qwen2.5-Omni achieves state-of-the-art performance on multimodal benchmarks like Omni-Bench. Notably, Qwen2.5-Omni ’s performance in end-to-end speech instruction following is comparable to its capabilities with text inputs, as evidenced by benchmarks such as MMLU and GSM8K. As for speech generation, Qwen2.5-Omni’s streaming Talker outperforms most existing streaming and non-streaming alternatives in robustness and naturalness.

2025-05-15 Qwen3 Technical Report Qwen Team Abstract In this work, we present Qwen3, the latest version of the Qwen model family. Qwen3 comprises a series of large language models (LLMs) designed to advance performance, efficiency, and multilingual capabilities. The Qwen3 series includes models of both dense and Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) architectures, with parameter scales ranging from 0.6 to 235 billion. A key innovation in Qwen3 is the integration of thinking mode (for complex, multi-step reasoning) and non-thinking mode (for rapid, context-driven responses) into a unified framework. This eliminates the need to switch between different models—–such as chat-optimized models (e.g., GPT-4o) and dedicated reasoning models (e.g., QwQ- 32B)—–and enables dynamic mode switching based on user queries or chat templates. Meanwhile, Qwen3 introduces a thinking budget mechanism, allowing users to allocate computational resources adaptively during inference, thereby balancing latency and performance based on task complexity. Moreover, by leveraging the knowledge from the flagship models, we significantly reduce the computational resources required to build smaller-scale models, while ensuring their highly competitive performance. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Qwen3 achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks, including tasks in code generation, mathematical reasoning, agent tasks, etc., competitive against larger MoE models and proprietary models. Compared to its predecessor Qwen2.5, Qwen3 expands multilingual support from 29 to 119 languages and dialects, enhancing global accessibility through improved cross-lingual understanding and generation capabilities. To facilitate reproducibility and community-driven research and development, all Qwen3 models are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0. 1 Introduction The pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI) or artificial super intelligence (ASI) has long been a goal for humanity. Recent advancements in large foundation models, e.g., GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2024), Claude 3.7 (Anthropic, 2025), Gemini 2.5 (DeepMind, 2025), DeepSeek-V3 (Liu et al., 2024a), Llama-4 (Meta-AI, 2025), and Qwen2.5 (Yang et al., 2024b), have demonstrated significant progress toward this objective. These models are trained on vast datasets spanning trillions of tokens across diverse domains and tasks, effectively distilling human knowledge and capabilities into their parameters. Furthermore, recent developments in reasoning models, optimized through reinforcement learning, highlight the potential for foundation models to enhance inference-time scaling and achieve higher levels of intelligence, e.g., o3 (OpenAI, 2025), DeepSeek-R1 (Guo et al., 2025). While most state-of-the-art models remain proprietary, the rapid growth of open-source communities has substantially reduced the performance gap between open-weight and closed-source models. Notably, an increasing number of top-tier models (Meta-AI, 2025; Liu et al., 2024a; Guo et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2024b) are now being released as open-source, fostering broader research and innovation in artificial intelligence. In this work, we introduce Qwen3, the latest series in our foundation model family, Qwen. Qwen3 is a collection of open-weight large language models (LLMs) that achieve state-of-the-art performance across a wide variety of tasks and domains. We release both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, with the number of parameters ranging from 0.6 billion to 235 billion, to meet the needs of different downstream applications. Notably, the flagship model, Qwen3-235B-A22B, is an MoE model with a total of 235 billion parameters and 22 billion activated ones per token. This design ensures both high performance and efficient inference. Qwen3 introduces several key advancements to enhance its functionality and usability. First, it integrates two distinct operating modes, thinking mode and non-thinking mode, into a single model. This allows users to switch between these modes without alternating between different models, e.g., switching from Qwen2.5 to QwQ (Qwen Team, 2024). This flexibility ensures that developers and users can adapt the model’s behavior to suit specific tasks efficiently. Additionally, Qwen3 incorporates thinking budgets, providing users with fine-grained control over the level of reasoning effort applied by the model during task execution. This capability is crucial to the optimization of computational resources and performance, tailoring the model’s thinking behavior to meet varying complexity in real-world applications. Furthermore, Qwen3 has been pre-trained on 36 trillion tokens covering up to 119 languages and dialects, effectively enhancing its multilingual capabilities. This broadened language support amplifies its potential for deployment in global use cases and international applications. These advancements together establish Qwen3 as a cutting-edge open-source large language model family, capable of effectively addressing complex tasks across various domains and languages. The pre-training process for Qwen3 utilizes a large-scale dataset consisting of approximately 36 trillion tokens, curated to ensure linguistic and domain diversity. To efficiently expand the training data, we employ a multi-modal approach: Qwen2.5-VL (Bai et al., 2025) is finetuned to extract text from extensive PDF documents. We also generate synthetic data using domain-specific models: Qwen2.5-Math (Yang et al., 2024c) for mathematical content and Qwen2.5-Coder (Hui et al., 2024) for code-related data. The pre-training process follows a three-stage strategy. In the first stage, the model is trained on about 30 trillion tokens to build a strong foundation of general knowledge. In the second stage, it is further trained on knowledge-intensive data to enhance reasoning abilities in areas like science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and coding. Finally, in the third stage, the model is trained on long-context data to increase its maximum context length from 4,096 to 32,768 tokens. To better align foundation models with human preferences and downstream applications, we employ a multi-stage post-training approach that empowers both thinking (reasoning) and non-thinking modes. In the first two stages, we focus on developing strong reasoning abilities through long chain-of-thought (CoT) cold-start finetuning and reinforcement learning focusing on mathematics and coding tasks. In the final two stages, we combine data with and without reasoning paths into a unified dataset for further fine-tuning, enabling the model to handle both types of input effectively, and we then apply generaldomain reinforcement learning to improve performance across a wide range of downstream tasks. For smaller models, we use strong-to-weak distillation, leveraging both off-policy and on-policy knowledge transfer from larger models to enhance their capabilities. Distillation from advanced teacher models significantly outperforms reinforcement learning in performance and training efficiency. We evaluate both pre-trained and post-trained versions of our models across a comprehensive set of benchmarks spanning multiple tasks and domains. Experimental results show that our base pre-trained models achieve state-of-the-art performance. The post-trained models, whether in thinking or nonthinking mode, perform competitively against leading proprietary models and large mixture-of-experts (MoE) models such as o1, o3-mini, and DeepSeek-V3. Notably, our models excel in coding, mathematics, and agent-related tasks. For example, the flagship model Qwen3-235B-A22B achieves 85.7 on AIME’24 and 81.5 on AIME’25 (AIME, 2025), 70.7 on LiveCodeBench v5 (Jain et al., 2024), 2,056 on CodeForces, and 70.8 on BFCL v3 (Yan et al., 2024). In addition, other models in the Qwen3 series also show strong performance relative to their size. Furthermore, we observe that increasing the thinking budget for thinking tokens leads to a consistent improvement in the model’s performance across various tasks. In the following sections, we describe the design of the model architecture, provide details on its training procedures, present the experimental results of pre-trained and post-trained models, and finally, conclude this technical report by summarizing the key findings and outlining potential directions for future research. 2 Architecture The Qwen3 series includes 6 dense models, namely Qwen3-0.6B, Qwen3-1.7B, Qwen3-4B, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-14B, and Qwen3-32B, and 2 MoE models, Qwen3-30B-A3B and Qwen3-235B-A22B. The flagship model, Qwen3-235B-A22B, has a total of 235B parameters with 22B activated ones. Below, we elaborate on the architecture of the Qwen3 models. The architecture of the Qwen3 dense models is similar to Qwen2.5 (Yang et al., 2024b), including using Grouped Query Attention (GQA, Ainslie et al., 2023), SwiGLU (Dauphin et al., 2017), Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE, Su et al., 2024), and RMSNorm (Jiang et al., 2023) with pre-normalization. Besides, we remove QKV-bias used in Qwen2 (Yang et al., 2024a) and introduce QK-Norm (Dehghani et al., 2023) to the attention mechanism to ensure stable training for Qwen3. Key information on model architecture is provided in Table 1. The Qwen3 MoE models share the same fundamental architecture as the Qwen3 dense models. Key information on model architecture is provided in Table 2. We follow Qwen2.5-MoE (Yang et al., 2024b) and implement fine-grained expert segmentation (Dai et al., 2024). The Qwen3 MoE models have 128 total experts with 8 activated experts per token. Unlike Qwen2.5-MoE, the Qwen3-MoE design excludes shared experts. Furthermore, we adopt the global-batch load balancing loss (Qiu et al., 2025) to encourage expert specialization. These architectural and training innovations have yielded substantial improvements in model performance across downstream tasks. Qwen3 models utilize Qwen’s tokenizer (Bai et al., 2023), which implements byte-level byte-pair encoding (BBPE, Brown et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Sennrich et al., 2016) with a vocabulary size of 151,669.

DeepSeek-V2: A Strong, Economical, and Efficient Mixture-of-Experts Language Model DeepSeek-AI research@deepseek.com Abstract We present DeepSeek-V2, a strong Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model characterized by economical training and efficient inference. It comprises 236B total parameters, of which 21B are activated for each token, and supports a context length of 128K tokens. DeepSeek-V2 adopts innovative architectures including Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and DeepSeekMoE.

Introduction In the past few years, Large Language Models (LLMs) (Anthropic, 2023; Google, 2023; OpenAI, 2022, 2023) have undergone rapid development, offering a glimpse into the dawn of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). In general, the intelligence of an LLM tends to improve as the number of parameters increases, allowing it to exhibit emergent capabilities across various tasks (Wei et al., 2022). However, the improvement comes at the cost of larger computing resources for training and a potential decrease in inference throughput. These constraints present significant challenges that impede the widespread adoption and utilization of LLMs. In order to tackle this problem, we introduce DeepSeek-V2, a strong open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model, characterized by economical training and efficient inference through an innovative Transformer architecture. It is equipped with a total of 236B parameters, of which 21B are activated for each token, and supports a context length of 128K tokens. We optimize the attention modules and Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) within the Transformer framework (Vaswani et al., 2017) with our proposed Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and DeepSeekMoE. (1) In the context of attention mechanisms, the Key-Value (KV) cache of the Multi-Head Attention (MHA) (Vaswani et al., 2017) poses a significant obstacle to the inference efficiency of LLMs. Various approaches have been explored to address this issue, including Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) (Ainslie et al., 2023) and Multi-Query Attention (MQA) (Shazeer, 2019). However, these methods often compromise performance in their attempt to reduce the KV cache. In order to achieve the best of both worlds, we introduce MLA, an attention mechanism equipped with low-rank key-value joint compression. Empirically, MLA achieves superior performance compared with MHA, and meanwhile significantly reduces the KV cache during inference, thus boosting the inference efficiency. (2) For Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs), we follow the DeepSeekMoE architecture (Dai et al., 2024), which adopts fine-grained expert segmentation and shared expert isolation for higher potential in expert specialization. The DeepSeekMoE architecture demonstrates great advantages compared with conventional MoE architectures like GShard (Lepikhin et al., 2021), enabling us to train strong models at an economical cost. As we employ expert parallelism during training, we also devise supplementary mechanisms to control communication overheads and ensure load balance. By combining these two techniques, DeepSeek-V2 features strong performance (Figure 1(a)), economical training costs, and efficient inference throughput (Figure 1(b)), simultaneously. We construct a high-quality and multi-source pre-training corpus consisting of 8.1T tokens. Compared with the corpus used in DeepSeek 67B (our previous release) (DeepSeek-AI, 2024), this corpus features an extended amount of data, especially Chinese data, and higher data quality. We first pretrain DeepSeek-V2 on the full pre-training corpus. Then, we collect 1.5M conversational sessions, which encompass various domains such as math, code, writing, reasoning, safety, and more, to perform Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for DeepSeek-V2 Chat (SFT). Finally, we follow DeepSeekMath (Shao et al., 2024) to employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to further align the model with human preference and produce DeepSeek-V2 Chat (RL). We evaluate DeepSeek-V2 on a wide range of benchmarks in English and Chinese, and compare it with representative open-source models. Evaluation results show that even with only 21B activated parameters, DeepSeek-V2 still achieves top-tier performance among open-source models and becomes the strongest open-source MoE language model. Figure 1(a) highlights that, on MMLU, DeepSeek-V2 achieves top-ranking performance with only a small number of activated parameters. In addition, as shown in Figure 1(b), compared with DeepSeek 67B, DeepSeek-V2 saves 42.5% of training costs, reduces the KV cache by 93.3%, and boosts the maximum generation throughput to 5.76 times.

MLA ensures efficient inference by significantly reducing the KV cache for generation, and DeepSeekMoE enables training strong models at an economical cost through the sparse architecture. DeepSeek-V2 Chat (RL) on open-ended benchmarks. Notably, DeepSeek-V2 Chat (RL) achieves 38.9 length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0 (Dubois et al., 2024), 8.97 overall score on MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2023), and 7.91 overall score on AlignBench (Liu et al., 2023). The English open-ended conversation evaluations demonstrate that DeepSeek-V2 Chat (RL) has toptier performance among open-source chat models. In addition, the evaluation on AlignBench indicates that in Chinese, DeepSeek-V2 Chat (RL) outperforms all of open-source models, and even beats most of closed-source models. In order to facilitate further research and development on MLA and DeepSeekMoE, we also release DeepSeek-V2-Lite, a smaller model equipped with MLA and DeepSeekMoE, for the open-source community. It has a total of 15.7B parameters, where 2.4B are activated for each token. Detailed descriptions about DeepSeek-V2-Lite can be found in Appendix B. In the rest of this paper, we first provide a detailed description of the model architecture of DeepSeek-V2 (Section 2). Subsequently, we introduce our pre-training endeavors, including the training data construction, hyper-parameter settings, infrastructures, long context extension, and the evaluation of model performance and efficiency (Section 3). Following this, we demonstrate our efforts in alignment, encompassing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Reinforcement Learning (RL), the evaluation results, and other discussion (Section 4). Finally, we summarize the conclusion, deliberate on the current limitations of DeepSeek-V2, and outline our future work (Section 5). 2. Architecture By and large, DeepSeek-V2 is still in the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), where each Transformer block consists of an attention module and a Feed-Forward Network (FFN). However, for both the attention module and the FFN, we design and employ innovative architectures. For attention, we design MLA, which utilizes low-rank key-value joint compression to eliminate the bottleneck of inference-time key-value cache, thus supporting efficient inference. For FFNs, we adopt the DeepSeekMoE architecture (Dai et al., 2024), a high-performance MoE architecture that enables training strong models at an economical cost. An illustration of the architecture of DeepSeek-V2 is presented in Figure 2, and we will introduce the details of MLA and DeepSeekMoE in this section. For other tiny details (e.g., layer normalization and the activation function in FFNs), unless specifically stated, DeepSeek-V2 follows the settings of DeepSeek 67B (DeepSeek-AI, 2024). 2.1. Multi-Head Latent Attention: Boosting Inference Efficiency Conventional Transformer models usually adopts Multi-Head Attention (MHA) (Vaswani et al., 2017), but during generation, its heavy Key-Value (KV) cache will become the bottleneck that limit the inference efficiency. In order to reduce the KV cache, Multi-Query Attention (MQA) (Shazeer, 2019) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) (Ainslie et al., 2023) are proposed. They require a smaller magnitude of KV cache, but their performance does not match MHA (we provide the ablation of MHA, GQA and MQA in Appendix D.1). For DeepSeek-V2, we design an innovative attention mechanism called Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA). Equipped with low-rank key-value joint compression, MLA achieves better performance than MHA, but requires a significantly smaller amount of KV cache. We introduce its architecture in the following, and also provide a comparison between MLA and MHA in Appendix D.2. 2.1.1. Preliminaries: Standard Multi-Head Attention We first introduce the standard MHA mechanism as background. Let dbe the embedding dimension, nhbe the number of attention heads, dhbe the dimension per head, and ht∈Rd be the attention input of the t-th token at an attention layer. Standard MHA first produces qt,kt,vt∈Rdhnhthrough three matrices WQ,WK,WV∈Rdhnh×d, respectively: qt=WQht, (1) kt=WKht, (2) vt=WVht, (3) Grouped -Query Attention (GQA) Multi-Head Attention (MHA) Multi-Query Attention (MQA) Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) Keys QueriesValues projection Compressed Latent KVCached During InferenceFigure 3|Simplified illustration of Multi-Head Attention (MHA), Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), Multi-Query Attention (MQA), and Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA). Through jointly compressing the keys and values into a latent vector, MLA significantly reduces the KV cache during inference. Then, qt,kt,vtwill be sliced into nhheads for the multi-head attention computation: [qt,1;qt,2;...;qt,nh]=qt, (4) [kt,1;kt,2;...;kt,nh]=kt, (5) [vt,1;vt,2;...;vt,nh]=vt, (6) ot,i=t∑︁ j=1Softmax j(qT t,ikj,i √ dh)vj,i, (7) ut=WO[ot,1;ot,2;...;ot,nh], (8) where qt,i,kt,i,vt,i∈Rdhdenote the query, key, and value of the i-th attention head, respectively; WO∈Rd×dhnhdenotes the output projection matrix. During inference, all keys and values need to be cached to accelerate inference, so MHA needs to cache 2nhdhlelements for each token. In model deployment, this heavy KV cache is a large bottleneck that limits the maximum batch size and sequence length. 2.1.2. Low-Rank Key-Value Joint Compression The core of MLA is the low-rank joint compression for keys and values to reduce KV cache: cKV t=WDKVht, (9) kC t=WUKcKV t, (10) vC t=WUVcKV t, (11) where cKV t∈Rdcis the compressed latent vector for keys and values; dc(≪dhnh)denotes the KV compression dimension; WDKV∈Rdc×dis the down-projection matrix; and WUK,WUV∈Rdhnh×dc are the up-projection matrices for keys and values, respectively. During inference, MLA only needs to cache cKV t, so its KV cache has only dclelements, where ldenotes the number of layers. In addition, during inference, since WUKcan be absorbed into WQ, andWUVcan be absorbed intoWO, we even do not need to compute keys and values out for attention. Figure 3 intuitively illustrates how the KV joint compression in MLA reduces the KV cache. Moreover, in order to reduce the activation memory during training, we also perform low-rank compression for the queries, even if it cannot reduce the KV cache: cQ t=WDQht, (12) qC t=WUQcQ t, (13) where cQ t∈Rd′ cis the compressed latent vector for queries; d′ c(≪dhnh)denotes the query compression dimension; and WDQ∈Rd′ c×d,WUQ∈Rdhnh×d′ care the down-projection and upprojection matrices for queries, respectively. 2.1.3. Decoupled Rotary Position Embedding Following DeepSeek 67B (DeepSeek-AI, 2024), we intend to use the Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) (Su et al., 2024) for DeepSeek-V2. However, RoPE is incompatible with low-rank KV compression. To be specific, RoPE is position-sensitive for both keys and queries. If we apply RoPE for the keys kC t,WUKin Equation 10 will be coupled with a position-sensitive RoPE matrix. In this way, WUKcannot be absorbed into WQany more during inference, since a RoPE matrix related to the currently generating token will lie between WQandWUKand matrix multiplication does not obey a commutative law. As a result, we must recompute the keys for all the prefix tokens during inference, which will significantly hinder the inference efficiency. As a solution, we propose the decoupled RoPE strategy that uses additional multi-head queries qR t,i∈RdR hand a shared key kR t∈RdR hto carry RoPE, where dR hdenotes the per-head dimension of the decoupled queries and key. Equipped with the decoupled RoPE strategy, MLA performs the following computation: [qR t,1;qR t,2;...;qR t,nh]=qR t=RoPE(WQRcQ t), (14) kR t=RoPE(WKRht), (15) qt,i=[qC t,i;qR t,i], (16) kt,i=[kC t,i;kR t], (17) ot,i=t∑︁ j=1Softmax j(qT t,ikj,i √︃ dh+dR h)vC j,i, (18) ut=WO[ot,1;ot,2;...;ot,nh], (19) whereWQR∈RdR hnh×d′ candWKR∈RdR h×dare matrices to produce the decouples queries and key, respectively; RoPE(·)denotes the operation that applies RoPE matrices; and [·;·]denotes the concatenation operation. During inference, the decoupled key should also be cached. Therefore, DeepSeek-V2 requires a total KV cache containing (dc+dR h)lelements. In order to demonstrate the complete computation process of MLA, we also organize and provide its full formulas in Appendix C. 2.1.4. Comparison of Key-Value Cache We demonstrate a comparison of the KV cache per token among different attention mechanisms in Table 1. MLA requires only a small amount of KV cache, equal to GQA with only 2.25 groups, but can achieve stronger performance than MHA. Attention Mechanism KV Cache per Token (# Element) Capability Multi-Head Attention (MHA) 2 nhdhl Strong Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) 2 ngdhl Moderate Multi-Query Attention (MQA) 2 dhl Weak MLA (Ours) (dc+dR h)l≈9 2dhl Stronger Table 1|Comparison of the KV cache per token among different attention mechanisms. nh denotes the number of attention heads, dhdenotes the dimension per attention head, ldenotes the number of layers, ngdenotes the number of groups in GQA, and dcanddR hdenote the KV compression dimension and the per-head dimension of the decoupled queries and key in MLA, respectively. The amount of KV cache is measured by the number of elements, regardless of the storage precision. For DeepSeek-V2, dcis set to 4dhanddR his set todh 2. So, its KV cache is equal to GQA with only 2.25 groups, but its performance is stronger than MHA. 2.2. DeepSeekMoE: Training Strong Models at Economical Costs 2.2.1. Basic Architecture For FFNs, we employ the DeepSeekMoE architecture (Dai et al., 2024). DeepSeekMoE has two key ideas: segmenting experts into finer granularity for higher expert specialization and more accurate knowledge acquisition, and isolating some shared experts for mitigating knowledge redundancy among routed experts. With the same number of activated and total expert parameters, DeepSeekMoE can outperform conventional MoE architectures like GShard (Lepikhin et al., 2021) by a large margin. Letutbe the FFN input of the t-th token, we compute the FFN output h′ tas follows: h′ t=ut+Ns∑︁ i=1FFN(s) i(ut)+Nr∑︁ i=1gi,tFFN(r) i(ut), (20) gi,t=(si,t,si,t∈Topk({sj,t|1⩽j⩽Nr},Kr), 0, otherwise,(21) si,t=Softmax i utTei, (22) whereNsandNrdenote the numbers of shared experts and routed experts, respectively; FFN(s) i(·) and FFN(r) i(·)denote the i-th shared expert and the i-th routed expert, respectively; Krdenotes the number of activated routed experts; gi,tis the gate value for the i-th expert; si,tis the tokento-expert affinity; eiis the centroid of the i-th routed expert in this layer; and Topk(·,K)denotes the set comprising Khighest scores among the affinity scores calculated for the t-th token and all routed experts. 2.2.2. Device-Limited Routing We design a device-limited routing mechanism to bound MoE-related communication costs. When expert parallelism is employed, the routed experts will be distributed across multiple devices. For each token, its MoE-related communication frequency is proportional to the number of devices covered by its target experts. Due to the fine-grained expert segmentation in DeepSeekMoE, the number of activated experts can be large, so the MoE-related communication will be more costly if we apply expert parallelism. For DeepSeek-V2, beyond the naive top-K selection of routed experts, we additionally ensure that the target experts of each token will be distributed on at most Mdevices. To be specific, for each token, we first select Mdevices that have experts with the highest affinity scores in them. Then, we perform top-K selection among experts on these Mdevices. In practice, we find that whenM⩾3, the device-limited routing can achieve a good performance roughly aligned with the unrestricted top-K routing. 2.2.3. Auxiliary Loss for Load Balance We take the load balance into consideration for automatically learned routing strategies. Firstly, unbalanced load will raise the risk of routing collapse (Shazeer et al., 2017), preventing some experts being fully trained and utilized. Secondly, when expert parallelism is employed, unbalanced load will diminish computation efficiency. During the training of DeepSeek-V2, we design three kinds of auxiliary losses, for controlling expert-level load balance (LExpBal), device-level load balance (LDevBal), and communication balance (LCommBal), respectively. Expert-Level Balance Loss. We use an expert-level balance loss (Fedus et al., 2021; Lepikhin et al., 2021) to mitigate the risk of routing collapse: LExpBal =α1Nr∑︁ i=1fiPi, (23) fi=Nr KrTT∑︁ t=11(Tokentselects Expert i), (24) Pi=1 TT∑︁ t=1si,t, (25) whereα1is a hyper-parameter called expert-level balance factor; 1(·)denotes the indicator function; and Tdenotes the number of tokens in a sequence. Device-Level Balance Loss. In addition to the expert-level balance loss, we additionally design a device-level balance loss to ensure balanced computation across different devices. In the training process of DeepSeek-V2, we partition all routed experts into Dgroups{E1,E2,...,ED}, and deploy each group on a single device. The device-level balance loss is computed as follows: LDevBal =α2D∑︁ i=1f′ iP′ i, (26) f′ i=1 |Ei|∑︁ j∈Eifj, (27) P′ i=∑︁ j∈EiPj, (28) whereα2is a hyper-parameter called device-level balance factor. Communication Balance Loss. Finally, we introduce a communication balance loss to ensure that the communication of each device is balanced. Although the device-limited routing mechanism guarantees that the sending communication of each device is bounded, if a certain device receives more tokens than other devices, the practical communication efficiency will also be affected. In order to mitigate this issue, we design a communication balance loss as follows: LCommBal =α3D∑︁ i=1f′′ iP′′ i, (29) f′′ i=D MTT∑︁ t=11(Tokentis sent to Device i), (30) P′′ i=∑︁ j∈EiPj, (31) whereα3is a hyper-parameter called communication balance factor. The device-limited routing mechanism operates on the principle of ensuring that each device transmits at most MThidden states to other devices. Simultaneously, the communication balance loss is employed to encourage each device to receive around MThidden states from other devices. The communication balance loss guarantees a balanced exchange of information among devices, promoting efficient communications. 2.2.4. Token-Dropping Strategy While balance losses aim to encourage a balanced load, it is important to acknowledge that they cannot guarantee a strict load balance. In order to further mitigate the computation wastage caused by unbalanced load, we introduce a device-level token-dropping strategy during training. This approach first computes the average computational budget for each device, which means that the capacity factor for each device is equivalent to 1.0. Then, inspired by Riquelme et al. (2021), we drop tokens with the lowest affinity scores on each device until reaching the computational budget. In addition, we ensure that the tokens belonging to approximately 10% of the training sequences will never be dropped. In this way, we can flexibly decide whether to drop tokens during inference according to the efficiency requirements, and always ensure consistency between training and inference. 3. Pre-Training 3.1. Experimental Setups 3.1.1. Data Construction While maintaining the same data processing stages as for DeepSeek 67B (DeepSeek-AI, 2024), we extend the amount of data and elevate the data quality. In order to enlarge our pre-training corpus, we explore the potential of the internet data and optimize our cleaning processes, thus recovering a large amount of mistakenly deleted data. Moreover, we incorporate more Chinese data, aiming to better leverage the corpus available on the Chinese internet. In addition to the amount of data, we also focus on the data quality. We enrich our pre-training corpus with high-quality data from various sources, and meanwhile improve the quality-based filtering algorithm. The improved algorithm ensures that a large amount of non-beneficial data will be removed, while the valuable data will be mostly retained. In addition, we filter out the contentious content from our pre-training corpus to mitigate the data bias introduced from specific regional cultures. A detailed discussion about the influence of this filtering strategy is presented in Appendix E. We adopt the same tokenizer as used in DeepSeek 67B, which is built based on the Byte-level Byte-Pair Encoding (BBPE) algorithm and has a vocabulary size of 100K. Our tokenized pretraining corpus contains 8.1T tokens, where Chinese tokens are approximately 12% more than English ones. 3.1.2. Hyper-Parameters Model Hyper-Parameters. We set the number of Transformer layers to 60 and the hidden dimension to 5120. All learnable parameters are randomly initialized with a standard deviation of 0.006. In MLA, we set the number of attention heads nhto 128 and the per-head dimension dh to 128. The KV compression dimension dcis set to 512, and the query compression dimension d′ cis set to 1536. For the decoupled queries and key, we set the per-head dimension dR hto 64. Following Dai et al. (2024), we substitute all FFNs except for the first layer with MoE layers. Each MoE layer consists of 2 shared experts and 160 routed experts, where the intermediate hidden dimension of each expert is 1536. Among the routed experts, 6 experts will be activated for each token. In addition, the low-rank compression and fine-grained expert segmentation will impact the output scale of a layer. Therefore, in practice, we employ additional RMS Norm layers after the compressed latent vectors, and multiply additional scaling factors at the width bottlenecks (i.e., the compressed latent vectors and the intermediate hidden states of routed experts) to ensure stable training. Under this configuration, DeepSeek-V2 comprises 236B total parameters, of which 21B are activated for each token. Training Hyper-Parameters. We employ the AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017) with hyper-parameters set to β1=0.9,β2=0.95, and weight_decay =0.1. The learning rate is scheduled using a warmup-and-step-decay strategy (DeepSeek-AI, 2024). Initially, the learning rate linearly increases from 0 to the maximum value during the first 2K steps. Subsequently, the learning rate is multiplied by 0.316 after training about 60% of tokens, and again by 0.316 after training about 90% of tokens. The maximum learning rate is set to 2.4×10−4, and the gradient clipping norm is set to 1.0. We also use a batch size scheduling strategy, where the batch size is gradually increased from 2304 to 9216 in the training of the first 225B tokens, and then keeps 9216 in the remaining training. We set the maximum sequence length to 4K, and train DeepSeek-V2 on 8.1T tokens. We leverage pipeline parallelism to deploy different layers of a model on different devices, and for each layer, the routed experts will be uniformly deployed on 8 devices (D=8). As for the device-limited routing, each token will be sent to at most 3 devices (M=3). As for balance losses, we set α1to 0.003,α2to 0.05, and α3to 0.02. We employ the token-dropping strategy during training for acceleration, but do not drop any tokens for evaluation. 3.1.3. Infrastructures DeepSeek-V2 is trained based on the HAI-LLM framework (High-flyer, 2023), an efficient and light-weight training framework developed internally by our engineers. It employs a 16-way zero-bubble pipeline parallelism (Qi et al., 2023), an 8-way expert parallelism (Lepikhin et al., 2021), and ZeRO-1 data parallelism (Rajbhandari et al., 2020). Given that DeepSeek-V2 has relatively few activated parameters, and a portion of the operators are recomputed to save activation memory, it can be trained without the necessity of tensor parallelism, thereby decreasing the communication overhead. Moreover, in order to further improve the training efficiency, we overlap the computation of shared experts with the expert parallel all-to-all communication. We also customize faster CUDA kernels for communications, routing algorithms, and fused 1K 12K 24K 35K 47K 58K 70K 81K 93K 104K 116K 128K Context Length (#Tokens)0 100Document Depth Percent (%)Pressure Testing DeepSeek-V2 Base 128K Context via "Needle In A HayStack" ScoreFigure 4|Evaluation results on the “Needle In A Haystack” (NIAH) tests. DeepSeek-V2 performs well across all context window lengths up to 128K. linear computations across different experts. In addition, MLA is also optimized based on an improved version of FlashAttention-2 (Dao, 2023). We conduct all experiments on a cluster equipped with NVIDIA H800 GPUs. Each node in the H800 cluster contains 8 GPUs connected using NVLink and NVSwitch within nodes. Across nodes, InfiniBand interconnects are utilized to facilitate communications. 3.1.4. Long Context Extension After the initial pre-training of DeepSeek-V2, we employ YaRN (Peng et al., 2023) to extend the default context window length from 4K to 128K. YaRN was specifically applied to the decoupled shared key kR tas it is responsible for carrying RoPE (Su et al., 2024). For YaRN, we set the scale sto 40,αto 1,βto 32, and the target maximum context length to 160K. Under these settings, we can expect the model to respond well for a context length of 128K. Slightly diverging from original YaRN, due to our distinct attention mechanism, we adjust the length scaling factor to modulate the attention entropy. The factor√ tis computed as√ t=0.0707 lns+1, aiming at minimizing the perplexity. We additionally train the model for 1000 steps, with a sequence length of 32K and a batch size of 576 sequences. Although the training is conducted solely at the sequence length of 32K, the model still demonstrates robust performance when being evaluated at a context length of 128K. As shown in Figure 4, the results on the “Needle In A Haystack” (NIAH) tests indicate that DeepSeek-V2 performs well across all context window lengths up to 128K. 3.2. Evaluations 3.2.1. Evaluation Benchmarks DeepSeek-V2 is pretrained on a bilingual corpus, so we evaluate it on a series of benchmarks in English and Chinese. Our evaluation is based on our internal evaluation framework integrated in our HAI-LLM framework. Included benchmarks are categorized and listed as follows, where underlined benchmarks are in Chinese: Multi-subject multiple-choice datasets include MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020), C-Eval (Huang et al., 2023), and CMMLU (Li et al., 2023). Language understanding and reasoning datasets include HellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019), PIQA (Bisk et al., 2020), ARC (Clark et al., 2018), and BigBench Hard (BBH) (Suzgun et al., 2022). Closed-book question answering datasets include TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017) and Natu- ralQuestions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). Reading comprehension datasets include RACE Lai et al. (2017), DROP (Dua et al., 2019), C3(Sun et al., 2019), and CMRC (Cui et al., 2019). Reference disambiguation datasets include WinoGrande Sakaguchi et al. (2019) and CLUEWSC (Xu et al., 2020). Language modeling datasets include Pile (Gao et al., 2020). Chinese understanding and culture datasets include CHID (Zheng et al., 2019) and CCPM (Li et al., 2021). Math datasets include GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021), and CMath (Wei et al., 2023). Code datasets include HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021), MBPP (Austin et al., 2021), and CRUXEval (Gu et al., 2024). Standardized exams include AGIEval (Zhong et al., 2023). Note that AGIEval includes both English and Chinese subsets. Following our previous work (DeepSeek-AI, 2024), we adopt perplexity-based evaluation for datasets including HellaSwag, PIQA, WinoGrande, RACE-Middle, RACE-High, MMLU, ARC-Easy, ARC-Challenge, CHID, C-Eval, CMMLU, C3, and CCPM, and adopt generationbased evaluation for TriviaQA, NaturalQuestions, DROP, MATH, GSM8K, HumanEval, MBPP, CRUXEval, BBH, AGIEval, CLUEWSC, CMRC, and CMath. In addition, we perform languagemodeling-based evaluation for Pile-test and use Bits-Per-Byte (BPB) as the metric to guarantee fair comparison among models with different tokenizers. For an intuitive overview of these benchmarks, we additionally provide our evaluation formats for each benchmark in Appendix G. 3.2.2. Evaluation Results In Table 2, we compare DeepSeek-V2 with several representative open-source models, including DeepSeek 67B (DeepSeek-AI, 2024) (our previous release), Qwen1.5 72B (Bai et al., 2023), LLaMA3 70B (AI@Meta, 2024), and Mixtral 8x22B (Mistral, 2024). We evaluate all these models with our internal evaluation framework, and ensure that they share the same evaluation setting. Overall, with only 21B activated parameters, DeepSeek-V2 significantly outperforms DeepSeek 67B on almost all benchmarks, and achieves top-tier performance among open-source models. Further, we elaborately compare DeepSeek-V2 with its open-source counterparts one by one. (1) Compared with Qwen1.5 72B, another model that supports both Chinese and English, DeepSeek-V2 demonstrates overwhelming advantages on the majority of English, code, and math benchmarks. As for Chinese benchmarks, Qwen1.5 72B shows better performance on Benchmark (Metric) # ShotsDeepSeek Qwen1.5 Mixtral LLaMA 3DeepSeek-V267B 72B 8x22B 70B Architecture - Dense Dense MoE Dense MoE # Activated Params - 67B 72B 39B 70B 21B # Total Params - 67B 72B 141B 70B 236B EnglishPile-test (BPB) - 0.642 0.637 0.623 0.602 0.606 BBH (EM) 3-shot 68.7 59.9 78.9 81.0 78.9 MMLU (Acc.) 5-shot 71.3 77.2 77.6 78.9 78.5 DROP (F1) 3-shot 69.7 71.5 80.4 82.5 80.1 ARC-Easy (Acc.) 25-shot 95.3 97.1 97.3 97.9 97.6 ARC-Challenge (Acc.) 25-shot 86.4 92.8 91.2 93.3 92.4 HellaSwag (Acc.) 10-shot 86.3 85.8 86.6 87.9 84.2 PIQA (Acc.) 0-shot 83.6 83.3 83.6 85.0 83.7 WinoGrande (Acc.) 5-shot 84.9 82.4 83.7 85.7 84.9 RACE-Middle (Acc.) 5-shot 69.9 63.4 73.3 73.3 73.1 RACE-High (Acc.) 5-shot 50.7 47.0 56.7 57.9 52.7 TriviaQA (EM) 5-shot 78.9 73.1 82.1 81.6 79.9 NaturalQuestions (EM) 5-shot 36.6 35.6 39.6 40.2 38.7 AGIEval (Acc.) 0-shot 41.3 64.4 43.4 49.8 51.2 CodeHumanEval (Pass@1) 0-shot 45.1 43.9 53.1 48.2 48.8 MBPP (Pass@1) 3-shot 57.4 53.6 64.2 68.6 66.6 CRUXEval-I (Acc.) 2-shot 42.5 44.3 52.4 49.4 52.8 CRUXEval-O (Acc.) 2-shot 41.0 42.3 52.8 54.3 49.8 MathGSM8K (EM) 8-shot 63.4 77.9 80.3 83.0 79.2 MATH (EM) 4-shot 18.7 41.4 42.5 42.2 43.6 CMath (EM) 3-shot 63.0 77.8 72.3 73.9 78.7 ChineseCLUEWSC (EM) 5-shot 81.0 80.5 77.5 78.3 82.2 C-Eval (Acc.) 5-shot 66.1 83.7 59.6 67.5 81.7 CMMLU (Acc.) 5-shot 70.8 84.3 60.0 69.3 84.0 CMRC (EM) 1-shot 73.4 66.6 73.1 73.3 77.5 C3 (Acc.) 0-shot 75.3 78.2 71.4 74.0 77.4 CHID (Acc.) 0-shot 92.1 - 57.0 83.2 92.7 CCPM (Acc.) 0-shot 88.5 88.1 61.0 68.1 93.1 Table 2|Comparison among DeepSeek-V2 and other representative open-source models. All models are evaluated in our internal framework and share the same evaluation setting. Bold denotes the best and underline denotes the second-best. Scores with a gap smaller than 0.3 are regarded as at the same level. With only 21B activated parameters, DeepSeek-V2 achieves top-tier performance among open-source models. multi-subject multiple-choice tasks while DeepSeek-V2 is comparable or better on others. Note that for the CHID benchmark, the tokenizer of Qwen1.5 72B will encounter errors in our evaluation framework, so we leave the CHID score blank for Qwen1.5 72B. (2) Compared with Mixtral 8x22B, DeepSeek-V2 achieves comparable or better English performance, except for TriviaQA, NaturalQuestions, and HellaSwag, which are closely related to English commonsense knowledge. Notably, DeepSeek-V2 outperforms Mixtral 8x22B on MMLU. On code and math benchmarks, DeepSeek-V2 demonstrates comparable performance with Mixtral 8x22B. Since Mixtral 8x22B is not specifically trained on Chinese data, its Chinese capability lags far behind DeepSeek-V2. (3) Compared with LLaMA3 70B, DeepSeek-V2 is trained on fewer than a quarter of English tokens. Therefore, we acknowledge that DeepSeek-V2 still has a slight gap in basic English capabilities with LLaMA3 70B. However, even with much fewer training tokens and activated parameters, DeepSeek-V2 still demonstrates comparable code and math capability with LLaMA3 70B. Also, as a bilingual language model, DeepSeek-V2 outperforms LLaMA3 70B overwhelmingly on Chinese benchmarks. Finally, it is worth mentioning that certain prior studies (Hu et al., 2024) incorporate SFT data during the pre-training stage, whereas DeepSeek-V2 has never been exposed to SFT data during pre-training. 3.2.3. Training and Inference Efficiency Training Costs. Since DeepSeek-V2 activates fewer parameters for each token and requires fewer FLOPs than DeepSeek 67B, training DeepSeek-V2 will be more economical than training DeepSeek 67B theoretically. Although training an MoE model will introduce additional communication overheads, through our operator and communication optimizations, the training for DeepSeek-V2 can attain a relatively high Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU). During our practical training on the H800 cluster, for training on each trillion tokens, DeepSeek 67B requires 300.6K GPU hours, while DeepSeek-V2 needs only 172.8K GPU hours, i.e., sparse DeepSeek-V2 can save 42.5% training costs compared with dense DeepSeek 67B. Inference Efficiency. In order to efficiently deploy DeepSeek-V2 for service, we first convert its parameters into the precision of FP8. In addition, we also perform KV cache quantization (Hooper et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2023) for DeepSeek-V2 to further compress each element in its KV cache into 6 bits on average. Benefiting from MLA and these optimizations, actually deployed DeepSeek-V2 requires significantly less KV cache than DeepSeek 67B, and thus can serve a much larger batch size. We evaluate the generation throughput of DeepSeek-V2 based on the prompt and generation length distribution from the actually deployed DeepSeek 67B service. On a single node with 8 H800 GPUs, DeepSeek-V2 achieves a generation throughput exceeding 50K tokens per second, which is 5.76 times the maximum generation throughput of DeepSeek 67B. In addition, the prompt input throughput of DeepSeek-V2 exceeds 100K tokens per second. 4. Alignment 4.1. Supervised Fine-T uning Building upon our prior research (DeepSeek-AI, 2024), we curate our instruction tuning datasets to include 1.5M instances, comprising 1.2M instances for helpfulness and 0.3M instances for safety. In comparison to the initial version, we improve the data quality to mitigate hallucinatory responses and enhance writing proficiency. We fine-tune DeepSeek-V2 with 2 epochs, and the learning rate is set to 5×10−6. For the evaluation of DeepSeek-V2 Chat (SFT), we mainly include generation-based benchmarks, except for several representative multiple-choice tasks (MMLU and ARC). We also conduct an instruction-following evaluation (IFEval) (Zhou et al., 2023) for DeepSeek-V2 Chat (SFT), using prompt-level loose accuracy as the metric. Moreover, we employ LiveCodeBench (Jain et al., 2024) questions from September 1st, 2023 to April 1st, 2024 to evaluate chat models. In addition to the standard benchmarks, we further evaluate our model on open-ended conversation benchmarks including MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2023), AlpacaEval 2.0 (Dubois et al., 2024), and AlignBench (Liu et al., 2023). For comparison, we also evaluate Qwen1.5 72B Chat, LLaMA-3-70B Instruct, and Mistral-8x22B Instruct in our evaluation framework and settings. As for DeepSeek 67B Chat, we directly refer to the evaluation results reported in our previous release. 4.2. Reinforcement Learning In order to further unlock the potential of DeepSeek-V2 and align it with human preference, we conduct Reinforcement Learning (RL) to adjust its preference. Reinforcement Learning Algorithm. In order to save the training costs of RL, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), which foregoes the critic model that is typically with the same size as the policy model, and estimates the baseline from group scores instead. Specifically, for each question q, GRPO samples a group of outputs {o1,o2,···,oG} from the old policy πθoldand then optimizes the policy model πθby maximizing the following objective: JGRPO(θ)=E[q∼P(Q),{oi}G i=1∼πθold(O|q)] GG∑︁ i=1 minπθ(oi|q) πθold(oi|q)Ai, clipπθ(oi|q) πθold(oi|q), 1−ε, 1+ε Ai −βDKL  πθ||πref,(32) DKL  πθ||πref=πref(oi|q) πθ(oi|q)−logπref(oi|q) πθ(oi|q)−1, (33) whereεandβare hyper-parameters; and Aiis the advantage, computed using a group of rewards{r1,r2,...,rG}corresponding to the outputs within each group: Ai=ri−mean({r1,r2,···,rG}) std({r1,r2,···,rG}). (34) Training Strategy. In our preliminary experiments, we find that the RL training on reasoning data, such as code and math prompts, exhibits unique characteristics that are distinct from the training on general data. For example, the mathematical and coding abilities of our model can keep improving over a longer period of training steps. Therefore, we employ a two-stage RL training strategy, which first performs reasoning alignment, and then performs human preference alignment. In the first reasoning alignment stage, we train a reward model RMreasoning for code and math reasoning tasks, and optimize the policy model with the feedback of RMreasoning: ri=RMreasoning(oi). (35) In the second human preference alignment stage, we adopt a multi-reward framework, which acquires rewards from a helpful reward model RMhelpful, a safety reward model RMsafety, and a rule-based reward model RMrule. The final reward of a response oiis ri=c1·RMhelpful(oi)+c2·RMsafety(oi)+c3·RMrule(oi), (36) wherec1,c2, andc3are corresponding coefficients. In order to obtain reliable reward models that play crucial roles in the RL training, we carefully collect preference data, and meticulously conduct quality filtering and proportion adjustments. We obtain code preference data based on compiler-feedback, and mathematical preference data based on the ground-truth labels. For reward model training, we initialize the reward models with DeepSeek-V2 Chat (SFT) and train them with either a point-wise or a pair-wise loss. In our experiments, we observe that the RL training can fully tap into and activate the potential of our model, enabling it to select the correct and satisfactory answer from possible responses. Optimizations for Training Efficiency. Conducting RL training on extremely large models places high demands on the training framework. It requires careful engineering optimization to manage the GPU memory and RAM pressure, and meanwhile maintain a fast training speed. For this goal, we implement the following engineering optimizations. (1) Firstly, we propose a hybrid engine that adopts different parallel strategies for training and inference respectively to achieve higher GPU utilization. (2) Secondly, we leverage vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023) with large batch sizes as our inference backend to accelerate the inference speed. (3) Thirdly, we carefully design a scheduling strategy for offloading models to CPUs and loading models back to GPUs, which achieves a near-optimal balance between the training speed and memory consumption. 4.3. Evaluation Results Evaluations on Standard Benchmarks. Initially, we evaluate DeepSeek-V2 Chat (SFT) and DeepSeek-V2 Chat (RL) on standard benchmarks. Notably, DeepSeek-V2 Chat (SFT) demonstrates substantial improvements in GSM8K, MATH, and HumanEval evaluations compared with its base version. This progress can be attributed to the inclusion of our SFT data, which comprises a considerable volume of math and code related content. In addition, DeepSeek-V2 Chat (RL) further boosts the performance on math and code benchmarks. We show more code and math evaluations in Appendix F. As for the comparisons with other models, we first compare DeepSeek-V2 Chat (SFT) with Qwen1.5 72B Chat, and find that DeepSeek-V2 Chat (SFT) surpasses Qwen1.5 72B Chat on almost all of English, math, and code benchmarks. On Chinese benchmarks, DeepSeek- V2 Chat (SFT) demonstrates slightly lower scores than Qwen1.5 72B Chat on multi-subject multiple-choice tasks, consistent with the performance observed from their base versions. When compared with the state-of-the-art open-source MoE model, Mixtral 8x22B Instruct, DeepSeek- V2 Chat (SFT) exhibits better performance on most benchmarks, except for NaturalQuestions and IFEval. Furthermore, in comparison to the state-of-the-art open-source model LLaMA3 70B Chat, DeepSeek-V2 Chat (SFT) shows similar performance in code and math related benchmarks. LLaMA3 70B Chat exhibits better performance on MMLU and IFEval, while DeepSeek-V2 Chat (SFT) showcases stronger performance on Chinese tasks. Ultimately, DeepSeek-V2 Chat (RL) demonstrates further enhanced performance in both mathematical and coding tasks compared with DeepSeek-V2 Chat (SFT). These comparisons highlight the strengths of DeepSeek-V2 Chat in relation to other language models in various domains and languages. Evaluations on Open-Ended Generation. We proceed with additional evaluations of our models on open-ended conversation benchmarks. For English open-ended conversation generation, we utilize MT-Bench and AlpacaEval 2.0 as the benchmarks. Evaluation results presented in Table 4 demonstrate a significant performance advantage of DeepSeek-V2 Chat (RL) over DeepSeek-V2 Chat (SFT). This outcome showcases the effectiveness of our RL training in achieving improved alignment. In comparison to other open-source models, DeepSeek-V2 Chat (RL) demonstrates superior performance over Mistral 8x22B Instruct and Qwen1.5 72B Chat on both benchmarks. When compared with LLaMA3 70B Instruct, DeepSeek-V2 Chat (RL) showcases competitive performance on MT-Bench and notably outperforms it on AlpacaEval 2.0. These results highlight the strong performance of DeepSeek-V2 Chat (RL) in generating high-quality and contextually relevant responses, particularly in instruction-based conversation tasks. In addition, we evaluate the Chinese open-ended generation capability based on AlignBench. As presented in Table 5, DeepSeek-V2 Chat (RL) exhibits a slight advantage over DeepSeek-V2 Chat (SFT). Notably, DeepSeek-V2 Chat (SFT) surpasses all open-source Chinese models by a significant margin. It significantly outperforms the second-best open-source model, Qwen1.5 Benchmark # ShotsDeepSeek Qwen 1.5 LLaMA3 Mixtral DeepSeek-V2 DeepSeek-V2 67B Chat 72B Chat 70B Inst. 8x22B Inst.

Regarding TriviaQA and NaturalQuestions, it is worth noting that chat models, such as LLaMA3 70B Instruct, might not strictly adhere to the format constraints typically specified in the few-shot setting. Consequently, this can lead to underestimation of certain models in our evaluation framework.

Moreover, both DeepSeek-V2 Chat (SFT) and DeepSeek-V2 Chat (RL) outperform GPT-4-0613 and ERNIEBot 4.0, solidifying the position of our models in the top-tier LLMs that support Chinese. Specifically, DeepSeek-V2 Chat (RL) shows remarkable performance in Chinese language understanding, which outperforms all models including GPT-4-Turbo-1106-Preview. On the other hand, the reasoning capability of DeepSeek-V2 Chat (RL) still lags behind giant models, such as Erniebot-4.0 and GPT-4s. Model OverallReasoning 中文推理 Language 中文语言 Avg. Math. Logi. Avg.

Suffixes of Erniebot-4.0 and Moonshot denote the timestamps when we called their API. 4.4. Discussion Amount of SFT Data. The discussion surrounding the necessity of a large SFT corpus has been a topic of intense debate. Previous works (Young et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2024) argue that fewer than 10K instances of SFT data are enough to produce satisfactory results. However, in our experiments, we observe a significant performance decline on the IFEval benchmark if we use fewer than 10K instances. A possible explanation is that, a language model necessitates a certain amount of data to develop specific skills. Although the requisite data amount may diminish with the model size increasing, it cannot be entirely eliminated. Our observation underscores the critical need for sufficient data to equip an LLM with desired capabilities. Moreover, the quality of SFT data is also crucial, especially for tasks involving writing or open-ended questions. Alignment Tax of Reinforcement Learning. During human preference alignment, we observe a significant performance enhancement on the open-ended generation benchmarks, in terms of the scores rated by both AI and human evaluators. However, we also notice a phenomenon of “alignment tax” (Ouyang et al., 2022), i.e., the alignment process can negatively impact the performance on some standard benchmarks such as BBH. In order to alleviate the alignment tax, during the RL stage, we make significant efforts in data processing and improving training strategies, finally achieving a tolerable trade-off between the performance on standard and open-ended benchmarks. Exploring how to align a model with human preferences without compromising its general performance presents a valuable direction for future research. Online Reinforcement Learning. In our preference alignment experiments, we find that the online approach significantly outperforms the offline approach. Therefore, we invest tremendous efforts in implementing an online RL framework for aligning DeepSeek-V2. The conclusion about online or offline preference alignment can vary in different contexts, and we reserve a more thorough comparison and analysis between them for future work. 5. Conclusion, Limitation, and Future Work In this paper, we introduce DeepSeek-V2, a large MoE language model that supports 128K context length. In addition to strong performance, it is also characterized by economical training and efficient inference, benefiting from its innovative architecture including MLA and DeepSeekMoE. In practice, compared with DeepSeek 67B, DeepSeek-V2 achieves significantly stronger performance, and meanwhile saves 42.5% of training costs, reduces the KV cache by 93.3%, and boosts the maximum generation throughput to 5.76 times. Evaluation results further demonstrate that with only 21B activated parameters, DeepSeek-V2 achieves top-tier performance among open-source models and becomes the strongest open-source MoE model. DeepSeek-V2 and its chat versions share the acknowledged limitations commonly found in other LLMs, including the lack of ongoing knowledge updates after pre-training, the possibility of generating non-factual information such as unverified advice, and a chance to produce hallucinations. In addition, since our data primarily consist of Chinese and English content, our model may exhibit limited proficiency in other languages. In scenarios beyond Chinese and English, it should be used with caution. DeepSeek will continuously invest in open-source large models with longtermism, aiming to progressively approach the goal of artificial general intelligence. •In our ongoing exploration, we are dedicated to devising methods that enable further scaling up MoE models while maintaining economical training and inference costs. The goal of our next step is to achieve performance on par with GPT-4 in our upcoming release. •Our alignment team continuously strives to enhance our models, aiming to develop a model that is not only helpful but also honest and safe for worldwide users. Our ultimate objective is to align the values of our model with human values, while minimizing the need for human supervision. By prioritizing ethical considerations and responsible development, we are dedicated to creating a positive and beneficial impact on society. •Currently, DeepSeek-V2 is designed to support the text modality exclusively.

Introduction In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been undergoing rapid iteration and evolution (Anthropic, 2024; Google, 2024; OpenAI, 2024a), progressively diminishing the gap towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Beyond closed-source models, open-source models, including DeepSeek series (DeepSeek-AI, 2024a,b,c; Guo et al., 2024), LLaMA series (AI@Meta, 2024a,b; Touvron et al., 2023a,b), Qwen series (Qwen, 2023, 2024a,b), and Mistral series (Jiang et al., 2023; Mistral, 2024), are also making significant strides, endeavoring to close the gap with their closed-source counterparts. To further push the boundaries of open-source model capabilities, we scale up our models and introduce DeepSeek-V3, a large Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with 671B parameters, of which 37B are activated for each token. With a forward-looking perspective, we consistently strive for strong model performance and economical costs. Therefore, in terms of architecture, DeepSeek-V3 still adopts Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) (DeepSeek-AI, 2024c) for efficient inference and DeepSeekMoE (Dai et al., 2024) for cost-effective training. These two architectures have been validated in DeepSeek- V2 (DeepSeek-AI, 2024c), demonstrating their capability to maintain robust model performance while achieving efficient training and inference. Beyond the basic architecture, we implement two additional strategies to further enhance the model capabilities. Firstly, DeepSeek-V3 pioneers an auxiliary-loss-free strategy (Wang et al., 2024a) for load balancing, with the aim of minimizing the adverse impact on model performance that arises from the effort to encourage load balancing. Secondly, DeepSeek-V3 employs a multi-token prediction training objective, which we have observed to enhance the overall performance on evaluation benchmarks. In order to achieve efficient training, we support the FP8 mixed precision training and implement comprehensive optimizations for the training framework. Low-precision training has emerged as a promising solution for efficient training (Dettmers et al., 2022; Kalamkar et al., 2019; Narang et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2023b), its evolution being closely tied to advancements in hardware capabilities (Luo et al., 2024; Micikevicius et al., 2022; Rouhani et al., 2023a). In this work, we introduce an FP8 mixed precision training framework and, for the first time, validate its effectiveness on an extremely large-scale model. Through the support for FP8 computation and storage, we achieve both accelerated training and reduced GPU memory usage. As for the training framework, we design the DualPipe algorithm for efficient pipeline parallelism, which has fewer pipeline bubbles and hides most of the communication during training through computation-communication overlap. This overlap ensures that, as the model further scales up, as long as we maintain a constant computation-to-communication ratio, we can still employ fine-grained experts across nodes while achieving a near-zero all-to-all communication overhead. In addition, we also develop efficient cross-node all-to-all communication kernels to fully utilize InfiniBand (IB) and NVLink bandwidths. Furthermore, we meticulously optimize the memory footprint, making it possible to train DeepSeek-V3 without using costly tensor parallelism. Combining these efforts, we achieve high training efficiency. During pre-training, we train DeepSeek-V3 on 14.8T high-quality and diverse tokens. The pre-training process is remarkably stable. Throughout the entire training process, we did not encounter any irrecoverable loss spikes or have to roll back. Next, we conduct a two-stage context length extension for DeepSeek-V3. In the first stage, the maximum context length is extended to 32K, and in the second stage, it is further extended to 128K. Following this, we conduct post-training, including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) on the base model of DeepSeek-V3, to align it with human preferences and further unlock its potential. During the post-training stage, we distill the reasoning capability from the DeepSeek- R1 series of models, and meanwhile carefully maintain the balance between model accuracy Training Costs Pre-Training Context Extension Post-Training Total in H800 GPU Hours 2664K 119K 5K 2788K in USD $5.328M $0.238M $0.01M $5.576M Table 1|Training costs of DeepSeek-V3, assuming the rental price of H800 is $2 per GPU hour. and generation length. We evaluate DeepSeek-V3 on a comprehensive array of benchmarks. Despite its economical training costs, comprehensive evaluations reveal that DeepSeek-V3-Base has emerged as the strongest open-source base model currently available, especially in code and math. Its chat version also outperforms other open-source models and achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models, including GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet, on a series of standard and open-ended benchmarks. Lastly, we emphasize again the economical training costs of DeepSeek-V3, summarized in Table 1, achieved through our optimized co-design of algorithms, frameworks, and hardware. During the pre-training stage, training DeepSeek-V3 on each trillion tokens requires only 180K H800 GPU hours, i.e., 3.7 days on our cluster with 2048 H800 GPUs. Consequently, our pretraining stage is completed in less than two months and costs 2664K GPU hours. Combined with 119K GPU hours for the context length extension and 5K GPU hours for post-training, DeepSeek-V3 costs only 2.788M GPU hours for its full training. Assuming the rental price of the H800 GPU is $2 per GPU hour, our total training costs amount to only $5.576M. Note that the aforementioned costs include only the official training of DeepSeek-V3, excluding the costs associated with prior research and ablation experiments on architectures, algorithms, or data. Our main contribution includes: Architecture: Innovative Load Balancing Strategy and Training Objective •On top of the efficient architecture of DeepSeek-V2, we pioneer an auxiliary-loss-free strategy for load balancing, which minimizes the performance degradation that arises from encouraging load balancing. •We investigate a Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) objective and prove it beneficial to model performance. It can also be used for speculative decoding for inference acceleration. Pre-Training: Towards Ultimate Training Efficiency •We design an FP8 mixed precision training framework and, for the first time, validate the feasibility and effectiveness of FP8 training on an extremely large-scale model. •Through the co-design of algorithms, frameworks, and hardware, we overcome the communication bottleneck in cross-node MoE training, achieving near-full computationcommunication overlap. This significantly enhances our training efficiency and reduces the training costs, enabling us to further scale up the model size without additional overhead. •At an economical cost of only 2.664M H800 GPU hours, we complete the pre-training of DeepSeek-V3 on 14.8T tokens, producing the currently strongest open-source base model. The subsequent training stages after pre-training require only 0.1M GPU hours. Post-Training: Knowledge Distillation from DeepSeek-R1 •We introduce an innovative methodology to distill reasoning capabilities from the long- Chain-of-Thought (CoT) model, specifically from one of the DeepSeek R1 series models, into standard LLMs, particularly DeepSeek-V3. Our pipeline elegantly incorporates the verification and reflection patterns of R1 into DeepSeek-V3 and notably improves its reasoning performance. Meanwhile, we also maintain control over the output style and length of DeepSeek-V3. Summary of Core Evaluation Results •Knowledge: (1) On educational benchmarks such as MMLU, MMLU-Pro, and GPQA, DeepSeek-V3 outperforms all other open-source models, achieving 88.5 on MMLU, 75.9 on MMLU-Pro, and 59.1 on GPQA. Its performance is comparable to leading closed-source models like GPT-4o and Claude-Sonnet-3.5, narrowing the gap between open-source and closed-source models in this domain. (2) For factuality benchmarks, DeepSeek-V3 demonstrates superior performance among open-source models on both SimpleQA and Chinese SimpleQA. While it trails behind GPT-4o and Claude-Sonnet-3.5 in English factual knowledge (SimpleQA), it surpasses these models in Chinese factual knowledge (Chinese SimpleQA), highlighting its strength in Chinese factual knowledge. •Code, Math, and Reasoning: (1) DeepSeek-V3 achieves state-of-the-art performance on math-related benchmarks among all non-long-CoT open-source and closed-source models. Notably, it even outperforms o1-preview on specific benchmarks, such as MATH-500, demonstrating its robust mathematical reasoning capabilities. (2) On coding-related tasks, DeepSeek-V3 emerges as the top-performing model for coding competition benchmarks, such as LiveCodeBench, solidifying its position as the leading model in this domain. For engineering-related tasks, while DeepSeek-V3 performs slightly below Claude-Sonnet-3.5, it still outpaces all other models by a significant margin, demonstrating its competitiveness across diverse technical benchmarks. In the remainder of this paper, we first present a detailed exposition of our DeepSeek-V3 model architecture (Section 2). Subsequently, we introduce our infrastructures, encompassing our compute clusters, the training framework, the support for FP8 training, the inference deployment strategy, and our suggestions on future hardware design. Next, we describe our pre-training process, including the construction of training data, hyper-parameter settings, longcontext extension techniques, the associated evaluations, as well as some discussions (Section 4). Thereafter, we discuss our efforts on post-training, which include Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Reinforcement Learning (RL), the corresponding evaluations, and discussions (Section 5). Lastly, we conclude this work, discuss existing limitations of DeepSeek-V3, and propose potential directions for future research (Section 6). 2. Architecture We first introduce the basic architecture of DeepSeek-V3, featured by Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) (DeepSeek-AI, 2024c) for efficient inference and DeepSeekMoE (Dai et al., 2024) for economical training. Then, we present a Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) training objective, which we have observed to enhance the overall performance on evaluation benchmarks. For other minor details not explicitly mentioned, DeepSeek-V3 adheres to the settings of DeepSeek- V2 (DeepSeek-AI, 2024c). 2.1. Basic Architecture The basic architecture of DeepSeek-V3 is still within the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) framework. For efficient inference and economical training, DeepSeek-V3 also adopts MLA and DeepSeekMoE, which have been thoroughly validated by DeepSeek-V2.

Figure 2 illustrates the basic architecture of DeepSeek-V3, and we will briefly review the details of MLA and DeepSeekMoE in this section. 2.1.1. Multi-Head Latent Attention For attention, DeepSeek-V3 adopts the MLA architecture. Let ddenote the embedding dimension,nhdenote the number of attention heads, dhdenote the dimension per head, and ht∈Rd denote the attention input for the t-th token at a given attention layer. The core of MLA is the low-rank joint compression for attention keys and values to reduce Key-Value (KV) cache during inference: cKV t=WDKVht, (1) [kC t,1;kC t,2;...;kC t,nh]=kC t=WUKcKV t, (2) kR t=RoPE(WKRht), (3) kt,i=[kC t,i;kR t], (4) [vC t,1;vC t,2;...;vC t,nh]=vC t=WUVcKV t, (5) where cKV t∈Rdcis the compressed latent vector for keys and values; dc(≪dhnh)indicates the KV compression dimension; WDKV∈Rdc×ddenotes the down-projection matrix; WUK,WUV∈Rdhnh×dc are the up-projection matrices for keys and values, respectively; WKR∈RdR h×dis the matrix used to produce the decoupled key that carries Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) (Su et al., 2024); RoPE(·)denotes the operation that applies RoPE matrices; and [·;·]denotes concatenation. Note that for MLA, only the blue-boxed vectors (i.e., cKV tand kR t) need to be cached during generation, which results in significantly reduced KV cache while maintaining performance comparable to standard Multi-Head Attention (MHA) (Vaswani et al., 2017). For the attention queries, we also perform a low-rank compression, which can reduce the activation memory during training: cQ t=WDQht, (6) [qC t,1;qC t,2;...;qC t,nh]=qC t=WUQcQ t, (7) [qR t,1;qR t,2;...;qR t,nh]=qR t=RoPE(WQRcQ t), (8) qt,i=[qC t,i;qR t,i], (9) where cQ t∈Rd′ cis the compressed latent vector for queries; d′ c(≪dhnh)denotes the query compression dimension; WDQ∈Rd′ c×d,WUQ∈Rdhnh×d′ care the down-projection and up-projection matrices for queries, respectively; and WQR∈RdR hnh×d′ cis the matrix to produce the decoupled queries that carry RoPE. Ultimately, the attention queries (qt,i), keys (kj,i), and values (vC j,i) are combined to yield the final attention output ut: ot,i=t∑︁ j=1Softmax j(qT t,ikj,i √︃ dh+dR h)vC j,i, (10) ut=WO[ot,1;ot,2;...;ot,nh], (11) whereWO∈Rd×dhnhdenotes the output projection matrix. 2.1.2. DeepSeekMoE with Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing Basic Architecture of DeepSeekMoE. For Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs), DeepSeek-V3 employs the DeepSeekMoE architecture (Dai et al., 2024). Compared with traditional MoE architectures like GShard (Lepikhin et al., 2021), DeepSeekMoE uses finer-grained experts and isolates some experts as shared ones. Let utdenote the FFN input of the t-th token, we compute the FFN output h′ tas follows: h′ t=ut+Ns∑︁ i=1FFN(s) i(ut)+Nr∑︁ i=1gi,tFFN(r) i(ut), (12) gi,t=g′ i,tÍNr j=1g′ j,t, (13) g′ i,t=(si,t,si,t∈Topk({sj,t|1⩽j⩽Nr},Kr), 0, otherwise,(14) si,t=Sigmoid utTei, (15) whereNsandNrdenote the numbers of shared experts and routed experts, respectively; FFN(s) i(·) and FFN(r) i(·)denote the i-th shared expert and the i-th routed expert, respectively; Krdenotes the number of activated routed experts; gi,tis the gating value for the i-th expert; si,tis the token-to-expert affinity; eiis the centroid vector of the i-th routed expert; and Topk(·,K)denotes the set comprising Khighest scores among the affinity scores calculated for the t-th token and all routed experts. Slightly different from DeepSeek-V2, DeepSeek-V3 uses the sigmoid function to compute the affinity scores, and applies a normalization among all selected affinity scores to produce the gating values. Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing. For MoE models, an unbalanced expert load will lead to routing collapse (Shazeer et al., 2017) and diminish computational efficiency in scenarios with expert parallelism. Conventional solutions usually rely on the auxiliary loss (Fedus et al., 2021; Lepikhin et al., 2021) to avoid unbalanced load. However, too large an auxiliary loss will impair the model performance (Wang et al., 2024a). To achieve a better trade-off between load balance and model performance, we pioneer an auxiliary-loss-free load balancing strategy (Wang et al., 2024a) to ensure load balance. To be specific, we introduce a bias term bifor each expert and add it to the corresponding affinity scores si,tto determine the top-K routing: g′ i,t=(si,t,si,t+bi∈Topk({sj,t+bj|1⩽j⩽Nr},Kr), 0, otherwise.(16) Note that the bias term is only used for routing. The gating value, which will be multiplied with the FFN output, is still derived from the original affinity score si,t. During training, we keep monitoring the expert load on the whole batch of each training step. At the end of each step, we will decrease the bias term by γif its corresponding expert is overloaded, and increase it by γif its corresponding expert is underloaded, where γis a hyper-parameter called bias update speed. Through the dynamic adjustment, DeepSeek-V3 keeps balanced expert load during training, and achieves better performance than models that encourage load balance through pure auxiliary losses. Complementary Sequence-Wise Auxiliary Loss. Although DeepSeek-V3 mainly relies on the auxiliary-loss-free strategy for load balance, to prevent extreme imbalance within any single sequence, we also employ a complementary sequence-wise balance loss: LBal=αNr∑︁ i=1fiPi, (17) fi=Nr KrTT∑︁ t=11  si,t∈Topk({sj,t|1⩽j⩽Nr},Kr), (18) s′ i,t=si,tÍNr j=1sj,t, (19) Pi=1 TT∑︁ t=1s′ i,t, (20) where the balance factor αis a hyper-parameter, which will be assigned an extremely small value for DeepSeek-V3; 1(·)denotes the indicator function; and Tdenotes the number of tokens in a sequence. The sequence-wise balance loss encourages the expert load on each sequence to be balanced.

We keep the complete causal chain for the prediction of each token at each depth. Node-Limited Routing. Like the device-limited routing used by DeepSeek-V2, DeepSeek-V3 also uses a restricted routing mechanism to limit communication costs during training. In short, we ensure that each token will be sent to at most Mnodes, which are selected according to the sum of the highestKr Maffinity scores of the experts distributed on each node. Under this constraint, our MoE training framework can nearly achieve full computation-communication overlap. No Token-Dropping. Due to the effective load balancing strategy, DeepSeek-V3 keeps a good load balance during its full training. Therefore, DeepSeek-V3 does not drop any tokens during training. In addition, we also implement specific deployment strategies to ensure inference load balance, so DeepSeek-V3 also does not drop tokens during inference. 2.2. Multi-Token Prediction Inspired by Gloeckle et al. (2024), we investigate and set a Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) objective for DeepSeek-V3, which extends the prediction scope to multiple future tokens at each position. On the one hand, an MTP objective densifies the training signals and may improve data efficiency. On the other hand, MTP may enable the model to pre-plan its representations for better prediction of future tokens. Figure 3 illustrates our implementation of MTP. Different from Gloeckle et al. (2024), which parallelly predicts Dadditional tokens using independent output heads, we sequentially predict additional tokens and keep the complete causal chain at each prediction depth. We introduce the details of our MTP implementation in this section. MTP Modules. To be specific, our MTP implementation uses Dsequential modules to predict D additional tokens. The k-th MTP module consists of a shared embedding layer Emb(·), a shared output head OutHead(·), a Transformer block TRMk(·), and a projection matrix Mk∈Rd×2d. For thei-th input token ti, at thek-th prediction depth, we first combine the representation of the i-th token at the(k−1)-th depth hk−1 i∈Rdand the embedding of the (i+k)-th tokenEmb(ti+k)∈Rd with the linear projection: h′k i=Mk[RMSNorm(hk−1 i); RMSNorm(Emb(ti+k))], (21) where[·;·]denotes concatenation. Especially, when k=1,hk−1 irefers to the representation given by the main model. Note that for each MTP module, its embedding layer is shared with the main model. The combined h′k iserves as the input of the Transformer block at the k-th depth to produce the output representation at the current depth hk i: hk 1:T−k=TRMk(h′k 1:T−k), (22) whereTrepresents the input sequence length and i:jdenotes the slicing operation (inclusive of both the left and right boundaries). Finally, taking hk ias the input, the shared output head will compute the probability distribution for the k-th additional prediction token Pk i+1+k∈RV, where Vis the vocabulary size: Pk i+k+1=OutHead(hk i). (23) The output head OutHead(·)linearly maps the representation to logits and subsequently applies theSoftmax(·)function to compute the prediction probabilities of the k-th additional token. Also, for each MTP module, its output head is shared with the main model. Our principle of maintaining the causal chain of predictions is similar to that of EAGLE (Li et al., 2024b), but its primary objective is speculative decoding (Leviathan et al., 2023; Xia et al., 2023), whereas we utilize MTP to improve training. MTP Training Objective. For each prediction depth, we compute a cross-entropy loss Lk MTP: Lk MTP=CrossEntropy(Pk 2+k:T+1,t2+k:T+1)=−1 TT+1∑︁ i=2+klogPk i[ti], (24) whereTdenotes the input sequence length, tidenotes the ground-truth token at the i-th position, andPk i[ti]denotes the corresponding prediction probability of ti, given by the k-th MTP module. Finally, we compute the average of the MTP losses across all depths and multiply it by a weighting factor λto obtain the overall MTP loss LMTP, which serves as an additional training objective for DeepSeek-V3: LMTP=λ DD∑︁ k=1Lk MTP. (25) MTP in Inference. Our MTP strategy mainly aims to improve the performance of the main model, so during inference, we can directly discard the MTP modules and the main model can function independently and normally. Additionally, we can also repurpose these MTP modules for speculative decoding to further improve the generation latency. 3. Infrastructures 3.1. Compute Clusters DeepSeek-V3 is trained on a cluster equipped with 2048 NVIDIA H800 GPUs. Each node in the H800 cluster contains 8 GPUs connected by NVLink and NVSwitch within nodes. Across different nodes, InfiniBand (IB) interconnects are utilized to facilitate communications.

Orange denotes forward, green denotes "backward for input", blue denotes "backward for weights", purple denotes PP communication, and red denotes barriers. Both all-to-all and PP communication can be fully hidden. 3.2. Training Framework The training of DeepSeek-V3 is supported by the HAI-LLM framework, an efficient and lightweight training framework crafted by our engineers from the ground up. On the whole, DeepSeek-V3 applies 16-way Pipeline Parallelism (PP) (Qi et al., 2023a), 64-way Expert Parallelism (EP) (Lepikhin et al., 2021) spanning 8 nodes, and ZeRO-1 Data Parallelism (DP) (Rajbhandari et al., 2020). In order to facilitate efficient training of DeepSeek-V3, we implement meticulous engineering optimizations. Firstly, we design the DualPipe algorithm for efficient pipeline parallelism. Compared with existing PP methods, DualPipe has fewer pipeline bubbles. More importantly, it overlaps the computation and communication phases across forward and backward processes, thereby addressing the challenge of heavy communication overhead introduced by cross-node expert parallelism. Secondly, we develop efficient cross-node all-to-all communication kernels to fully utilize IB and NVLink bandwidths and conserve Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs) dedicated to communication. Finally, we meticulously optimize the memory footprint during training, thereby enabling us to train DeepSeek-V3 without using costly Tensor Parallelism (TP). 3.2.1. DualPipe and Computation-Communication Overlap For DeepSeek-V3, the communication overhead introduced by cross-node expert parallelism results in an inefficient computation-to-communication ratio of approximately 1:1. To tackle this challenge, we design an innovative pipeline parallelism algorithm called DualPipe, which not only accelerates model training by effectively overlapping forward and backward computationcommunication phases, but also reduces the pipeline bubbles. The key idea of DualPipe is to overlap the computation and communication within a pair of individual forward and backward chunks. To be specific, we divide each chunk into four components: attention,all-to-all dispatch,MLP, and all-to-all combine. Specially, for a backward chunk, both attention andMLP are further split into two parts, backward for input andbackward for weights, like in ZeroBubble (Qi et al., 2023b). In addition, we have a PP communication component. As illustrated in Figure 4, for a pair of forward and backward chunks, we rearrange these components and manually adjust the ratio of GPU SMs dedicated to communication versus computation. In this overlapping strategy, we can ensure that both all-to-all and PP communication can be fully hidden during execution. Given the efficient overlapping strategy, the full DualPipe scheduling is illustrated in Figure 5. It employs a bidirectional pipeline scheduling, which feeds micro-batches from both ends of the pipeline simultaneously and a significant portion of communications can be fully overlapped. This overlap also ensures that, as the model further scales up, as long as we maintain a constant computation-to-communication ratio, we can still employ fine-grained experts across nodes while achieving a near-zero all-to-all communication overhead.

In addition, even in more general scenarios without a heavy communication burden, Du- alPipe still exhibits efficiency advantages. In Table 2, we summarize the pipeline bubbles and memory usage across different PP methods. As shown in the table, compared with ZB1P (Qi et al., 2023b) and 1F1B (Harlap et al., 2018), DualPipe significantly reduces the pipeline bubbles while only increasing the peak activation memory by1 PPtimes. Although DualPipe requires keeping two copies of the model parameters, this does not significantly increase the memory consumption since we use a large EP size during training. Compared with Chimera (Li and Hoefler, 2021), DualPipe only requires that the pipeline stages and micro-batches be divisible by 2, without requiring micro-batches to be divisible by pipeline stages. In addition, for DualPipe, neither the bubbles nor activation memory will increase as the number of micro-batches grows. 3.2.2. Efficient Implementation of Cross-Node All-to-All Communication In order to ensure sufficient computational performance for DualPipe, we customize efficient cross-node all-to-all communication kernels (including dispatching and combining) to conserve the number of SMs dedicated to communication. The implementation of the kernels is codesigned with the MoE gating algorithm and the network topology of our cluster. To be specific, in our cluster, cross-node GPUs are fully interconnected with IB, and intra-node communications are handled via NVLink. NVLink offers a bandwidth of 160 GB/s, roughly 3.2 times that of IB (50 GB/s). To effectively leverage the different bandwidths of IB and NVLink, we limit each token to be dispatched to at most 4 nodes, thereby reducing IB traffic. For each token, when its routing decision is made, it will first be transmitted via IB to the GPUs with the same in-node index on its target nodes. Once it reaches the target nodes, we will endeavor to ensure that it is instantaneously forwarded via NVLink to specific GPUs that host their target experts, without being blocked by subsequently arriving tokens. In this way, communications via IB and NVLink are fully overlapped, and each token can efficiently select an average of 3.2 experts per node without incurring additional overhead from NVLink. This implies that, although DeepSeek-V3 selects only 8 routed experts in practice, it can scale up this number to a maximum of 13 experts (4 nodes×3.2 experts/node) while preserving the same communication cost. Overall, under such a communication strategy, only 20 SMs are sufficient to fully utilize the bandwidths of IB and NVLink. In detail, we employ the warp specialization technique (Bauer et al., 2014) and partition 20 SMs into 10 communication channels. During the dispatching process, (1) IB sending, (2) IB-to-NVLink forwarding, and (3) NVLink receiving are handled by respective warps. The number of warps allocated to each communication task is dynamically adjusted according to the actual workload across all SMs. Similarly, during the combining process, (1) NVLink sending, (2) NVLink-to-IB forwarding and accumulation, and (3) IB receiving and accumulation are also handled by dynamically adjusted warps. In addition, both dispatching and combining kernels overlap with the computation stream, so we also consider their impact on other SM computation kernels. Specifically, we employ customized PTX (Parallel Thread Execution) instructions and auto-tune the communication chunk size, which significantly reduces the use of the L2 cache and the interference to other SMs. 3.2.3. Extremely Memory Saving with Minimal Overhead In order to reduce the memory footprint during training, we employ the following techniques. Recomputation of RMSNorm and MLA Up-Projection. We recompute all RMSNorm operations and MLA up-projections during back-propagation, thereby eliminating the need to persistently store their output activations. With a minor overhead, this strategy significantly reduces memory requirements for storing activations. Exponential Moving Average in CPU. During training, we preserve the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the model parameters for early estimation of the model performance after learning rate decay. The EMA parameters are stored in CPU memory and are updated asynchronously after each training step. This method allows us to maintain EMA parameters without incurring additional memory or time overhead. Shared Embedding and Output Head for Multi-Token Prediction. With the DualPipe strategy, we deploy the shallowest layers (including the embedding layer) and deepest layers (including the output head) of the model on the same PP rank. This arrangement enables the physical sharing of parameters and gradients, of the shared embedding and output head, between the MTP module and the main model. This physical sharing mechanism further enhances our memory efficiency. 3.3. FP8 Training Inspired by recent advances in low-precision training (Dettmers et al., 2022; Noune et al., 2022; Peng et al., 2023b), we propose a fine-grained mixed precision framework utilizing the FP8 data format for training DeepSeek-V3. While low-precision training holds great promise, it is often limited by the presence of outliers in activations, weights, and gradients (Fishman et al., 2024; He et al.; Sun et al., 2024). Although significant progress has been made in inference quantization (Frantar et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2023), there are relatively few studies demonstrating successful application of low-precision techniques in large-scale language model ΣFprop FP32 Input To FP8 BF16 Weight ΣDgrad FP32 Input Gradient Output Output Gradient BF16 To FP8 ΣWgrad FP32 To FP8 To FP8 Weight Gradient Optimizer States To BF16 Master Weight To FP8 To BF16 To BF16 To FP32 或者Input->Activation_L Output->Activation_{L+1} FP32 Figure 6|The overall mixed precision framework with FP8 data format. For clarification, only theLinear operator is illustrated. pre-training (Fishman et al., 2024). To address this challenge and effectively extend the dynamic range of the FP8 format, we introduce a fine-grained quantization strategy: tile-wise grouping with 1×Ncelements or block-wise grouping with Nc×Ncelements. The associated dequantization overhead is largely mitigated under our increased-precision accumulation process, a critical aspect for achieving accurate FP8 General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM). Moreover, to further reduce memory and communication overhead in MoE training, we cache and dispatch activations in FP8, while storing low-precision optimizer states in BF16. We validate the proposed FP8 mixed precision framework on two model scales similar to DeepSeek-V2-Lite and DeepSeek- V2, training for approximately 1 trillion tokens (see more details in Appendix B.1). Notably, compared with the BF16 baseline, the relative loss error of our FP8-training model remains consistently below 0.25%, a level well within the acceptable range of training randomness. 3.3.1. Mixed Precision Framework Building upon widely adopted techniques in low-precision training (Kalamkar et al., 2019; Narang et al., 2017), we propose a mixed precision framework for FP8 training. In this framework, most compute-density operations are conducted in FP8, while a few key operations are strategically maintained in their original data formats to balance training efficiency and numerical stability. The overall framework is illustrated in Figure 6. Firstly, in order to accelerate model training, the majority of core computation kernels, i.e., GEMM operations, are implemented in FP8 precision. These GEMM operations accept FP8 tensors as inputs and produce outputs in BF16 or FP32. As depicted in Figure 6, all three GEMMs associated with the Linear operator, namely Fprop (forward pass), Dgrad (activation backward pass), and Wgrad (weight backward pass), are executed in FP8. This design theoretically doubles the computational speed compared with the original BF16 method. Additionally, the FP8 Wgrad GEMM allows activations to be stored in FP8 for use in the backward pass. This significantly reduces memory consumption. Despite the efficiency advantage of the FP8 format, certain operators still require a higher precision due to their sensitivity to low-precision computations. Besides, some low-cost operators can also utilize a higher precision with a negligible overhead to the overall training cost. For this reason, after careful investigations, we maintain the original precision (e.g., BF16 or FP32) for the following components: the embedding module, the output head, MoE gating modules, normalization operators, and attention operators. These targeted retentions of high precision ensure stable training dynamics for DeepSeek-V3. To further guarantee numerical stability, we store the master weights, weight gradients, and optimizer states in higher precision. While Scaling Factor............

(b) In conjunction with our quantization strategy, we improve the FP8 GEMM precision by promoting to CUDA Cores at an interval of NC=128 elements MMA for the high-precision accumulation. these high-precision components incur some memory overheads, their impact can be minimized through efficient sharding across multiple DP ranks in our distributed training system. 3.3.2. Improved Precision from Quantization and Multiplication Based on our mixed precision FP8 framework, we introduce several strategies to enhance lowprecision training accuracy, focusing on both the quantization method and the multiplication process. Fine-Grained Quantization. In low-precision training frameworks, overflows and underflows are common challenges due to the limited dynamic range of the FP8 format, which is constrained by its reduced exponent bits. As a standard practice, the input distribution is aligned to the representable range of the FP8 format by scaling the maximum absolute value of the input tensor to the maximum representable value of FP8 (Narang et al., 2017). This method makes lowprecision training highly sensitive to activation outliers, which can heavily degrade quantization accuracy. To solve this, we propose a fine-grained quantization method that applies scaling at a more granular level. As illustrated in Figure 7 (a), (1) for activations, we group and scale elements on a 1x128 tile basis (i.e., per token per 128 channels); and (2) for weights, we group and scale elements on a 128x128 block basis (i.e., per 128 input channels per 128 output channels). This approach ensures that the quantization process can better accommodate outliers by adapting the scale according to smaller groups of elements. In Appendix B.2, we further discuss the training instability when we group and scale activations on a block basis in the same way as weights quantization. One key modification in our method is the introduction of per-group scaling factors along the inner dimension of GEMM operations. This functionality is not directly supported in the standard FP8 GEMM. However, combined with our precise FP32 accumulation strategy, it can be efficiently implemented. Notably, our fine-grained quantization strategy is highly consistent with the idea of microscaling formats (Rouhani et al., 2023b), while the Tensor Cores of NVIDIA next-generation GPUs (Blackwell series) have announced the support for microscaling formats with smaller quantization granularity (NVIDIA, 2024a). We hope our design can serve as a reference for future work to keep pace with the latest GPU architectures. Increasing Accumulation Precision. Low-precision GEMM operations often suffer from underflow issues, and their accuracy largely depends on high-precision accumulation, which is commonly performed in an FP32 precision (Kalamkar et al., 2019; Narang et al., 2017). However, we observe that the accumulation precision of FP8 GEMM on NVIDIA H800 GPUs is limited to retaining around 14 bits, which is significantly lower than FP32 accumulation precision. This problem will become more pronounced when the inner dimension Kis large (Wortsman et al., 2023), a typical scenario in large-scale model training where the batch size and model width are increased. Taking GEMM operations of two random matrices with K= 4096 for example, in our preliminary test, the limited accumulation precision in Tensor Cores results in a maximum relative error of nearly 2%. Despite these problems, the limited accumulation precision is still the default option in a few FP8 frameworks (NVIDIA, 2024b), severely constraining the training accuracy. In order to address this issue, we adopt the strategy of promotion to CUDA Cores for higher precision (Thakkar et al., 2023). The process is illustrated in Figure 7 (b). To be specific, during MMA (Matrix Multiply-Accumulate) execution on Tensor Cores, intermediate results are accumulated using the limited bit width. Once an interval of NCis reached, these partial results will be copied to FP32 registers on CUDA Cores, where full-precision FP32 accumulation is performed. As mentioned before, our fine-grained quantization applies per-group scaling factors along the inner dimension K. These scaling factors can be efficiently multiplied on the CUDA Cores as the dequantization process with minimal additional computational cost. It is worth noting that this modification reduces the WGMMA (Warpgroup-level Matrix Multiply-Accumulate) instruction issue rate for a single warpgroup. However, on the H800 architecture, it is typical for two WGMMA to persist concurrently: while one warpgroup performs the promotion operation, the other is able to execute the MMA operation. This design enables overlapping of the two operations, maintaining high utilization of Tensor Cores. Based on our experiments, setting NC=128elements, equivalent to 4 WGMMAs, represents the minimal accumulation interval that can significantly improve precision without introducing substantial overhead. Mantissa over Exponents. In contrast to the hybrid FP8 format adopted by prior work (NVIDIA, 2024b; Peng et al., 2023b; Sun et al., 2019b), which uses E4M3 (4-bit exponent and 3-bit mantissa) in Fprop andE5M2 (5-bit exponent and 2-bit mantissa) in Dgrad andWgrad, we adopt the E4M3 format on all tensors for higher precision. We attribute the feasibility of this approach to our fine-grained quantization strategy, i.e., tile and block-wise scaling. By operating on smaller element groups, our methodology effectively shares exponent bits among these grouped elements, mitigating the impact of the limited dynamic range. Online Quantization. Delayed quantization is employed in tensor-wise quantization frameworks (NVIDIA, 2024b; Peng et al., 2023b), which maintains a history of the maximum absolute values across prior iterations to infer the current value. In order to ensure accurate scales and simplify the framework, we calculate the maximum absolute value online for each 1x128 activation tile or 128x128 weight block. Based on it, we derive the scaling factor and then quantize the activation or weight online into the FP8 format. 3.3.3. Low-Precision Storage and Communication In conjunction with our FP8 training framework, we further reduce the memory consumption and communication overhead by compressing cached activations and optimizer states into lower-precision formats. Low-Precision Optimizer States. We adopt the BF16 data format instead of FP32 to track the first and second moments in the AdamW (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017) optimizer, without incurring observable performance degradation. However, the master weights (stored by the optimizer) and gradients (used for batch size accumulation) are still retained in FP32 to ensure numerical stability throughout training. Low-Precision Activation. As illustrated in Figure 6, the Wgrad operation is performed in FP8. To reduce the memory consumption, it is a natural choice to cache activations in FP8 format for the backward pass of the Linear operator. However, special considerations are taken on several operators for low-cost high-precision training: (1) Inputs of the Linear after the attention operator. These activations are also used in the backward pass of the attention operator, which makes it sensitive to precision. We adopt a customized E5M6 data format exclusively for these activations. Additionally, these activations will be converted from an 1x128 quantization tile to an128x1 tile in the backward pass. To avoid introducing extra quantization error, all the scaling factors are round scaled, i.e., integral power of 2. (2) Inputs of the SwiGLU operator in MoE. To further reduce the memory cost, we cache the inputs of the SwiGLU operator and recompute its output in the backward pass. These activations are also stored in FP8 with our fine-grained quantization method, striking a balance between memory efficiency and computational accuracy. Low-Precision Communication. Communication bandwidth is a critical bottleneck in the training of MoE models. To alleviate this challenge, we quantize the activation before MoE up-projections into FP8 and then apply dispatch components, which is compatible with FP8Fprop in MoE up-projections. Like the inputs of the Linear after the attention operator, scaling factors for this activation are integral power of 2. A similar strategy is applied to the activation gradient before MoE down-projections. For both the forward and backward combine components, we retain them in BF16 to preserve training precision in critical parts of the training pipeline. 3.4. Inference and Deployment We deploy DeepSeek-V3 on the H800 cluster, where GPUs within each node are interconnected using NVLink, and all GPUs across the cluster are fully interconnected via IB. To simultaneously ensure both the Service-Level Objective (SLO) for online services and high throughput, we employ the following deployment strategy that separates the prefilling and decoding stages. 3.4.1. Prefilling The minimum deployment unit of the prefilling stage consists of 4 nodes with 32 GPUs. The attention part employs 4-way Tensor Parallelism (TP4) with Sequence Parallelism (SP), combined with 8-way Data Parallelism (DP8). Its small TP size of 4 limits the overhead of TP communication. For the MoE part, we use 32-way Expert Parallelism (EP32), which ensures that each expert processes a sufficiently large batch size, thereby enhancing computational efficiency. For the MoE all-to-all communication, we use the same method as in training: first transferring tokens across nodes via IB, and then forwarding among the intra-node GPUs via NVLink. In particular, we use 1-way Tensor Parallelism for the dense MLPs in shallow layers to save TP communication. To achieve load balancing among different experts in the MoE part, we need to ensure that each GPU processes approximately the same number of tokens. To this end, we introduce a deployment strategy of redundant experts, which duplicates high-load experts and deploys them redundantly. The high-load experts are detected based on statistics collected during the online deployment and are adjusted periodically (e.g., every 10 minutes). After determining the set of redundant experts, we carefully rearrange experts among GPUs within a node based on the observed loads, striving to balance the load across GPUs as much as possible without increasing the cross-node all-to-all communication overhead. For the deployment of DeepSeek-V3, we set 32 redundant experts for the prefilling stage. For each GPU, besides the original 8 experts it hosts, it will also host one additional redundant expert. Furthermore, in the prefilling stage, to improve the throughput and hide the overhead of all-to-all and TP communication, we simultaneously process two micro-batches with similar computational workloads, overlapping the attention andMoE of one micro-batch with the dispatch andcombine of another. Finally, we are exploring a dynamic redundancy strategy for experts, where each GPU hosts more experts (e.g., 16 experts), but only 9 will be activated during each inference step. Before the all-to-all operation at each layer begins, we compute the globally optimal routing scheme on the fly. Given the substantial computation involved in the prefilling stage, the overhead of computing this routing scheme is almost negligible. 3.4.2. Decoding During decoding, we treat the shared expert as a routed one. From this perspective, each token will select 9 experts during routing, where the shared expert is regarded as a heavy-load one that will always be selected. The minimum deployment unit of the decoding stage consists of 40 nodes with 320 GPUs. The attention part employs TP4 with SP, combined with DP80, while the MoE part uses EP320. For the MoE part, each GPU hosts only one expert, and 64 GPUs are responsible for hosting redundant experts and shared experts. All-to-all communication of the dispatch andcombine parts is performed via direct point-to-point transfers over IB to achieve low latency. Additionally, we leverage the IBGDA (NVIDIA, 2022) technology to further minimize latency and enhance communication efficiency. Similar to prefilling, we periodically determine the set of redundant experts in a certain interval, based on the statistical expert load from our online service. However, we do not need to rearrange experts since each GPU only hosts one expert. We are also exploring the dynamic redundancy strategy for decoding. However, this requires more careful optimization of the algorithm that computes the globally optimal routing scheme and the fusion with the dispatch kernel to reduce overhead. Additionally, to enhance throughput and hide the overhead of all-to-all communication, we are also exploring processing two micro-batches with similar computational workloads simultaneously in the decoding stage. Unlike prefilling, attention consumes a larger portion of time in the decoding stage. Therefore, we overlap the attention of one micro-batch with thedispatch+MoE+combine of another. In the decoding stage, the batch size per expert is relatively small (usually within 256 tokens), and the bottleneck is memory access rather than computation. Since the MoE part only needs to load the parameters of one expert, the memory access overhead is minimal, so using fewer SMs will not significantly affect the overall performance. Therefore, to avoid impacting the computation speed of the attention part, we can allocate only a small portion of SMs to dispatch+MoE+combine. 3.5. Suggestions on Hardware Design Based on our implementation of the all-to-all communication and FP8 training scheme, we propose the following suggestions on chip design to AI hardware vendors. 3.5.1. Communication Hardware In DeepSeek-V3, we implement the overlap between computation and communication to hide the communication latency during computation. This significantly reduces the dependency on communication bandwidth compared to serial computation and communication. However, the current communication implementation relies on expensive SMs (e.g., we allocate 20 out of the 132 SMs available in the H800 GPU for this purpose), which will limit the computational throughput. Moreover, using SMs for communication results in significant inefficiencies, as tensor cores remain entirely under-utilized. Currently, the SMs primarily perform the following tasks for all-to-all communication: •Forwarding data between the IB (InfiniBand) and NVLink domain while aggregating IB traffic destined for multiple GPUs within the same node from a single GPU. •Transporting data between RDMA buffers (registered GPU memory regions) and input/output buffers. •Executing reduce operations forall-to-all combine. •Managing fine-grained memory layout during chunked data transferring to multiple experts across the IB and NVLink domain. We aspire to see future vendors developing hardware that offloads these communication tasks from the valuable computation unit SM, serving as a GPU co-processor or a network co-processor like NVIDIA SHARP Graham et al. (2016). Furthermore, to reduce application programming complexity, we aim for this hardware to unify the IB (scale-out) and NVLink (scale-up) networks from the perspective of the computation units. With this unified interface, computation units can easily accomplish operations such as read,write,multicast, and reduce across the entire IB-NVLink-unified domain via submitting communication requests based on simple primitives. 3.5.2. Compute Hardware Higher FP8 GEMM Accumulation Precision in Tensor Cores. In the current Tensor Core implementation of the NVIDIA Hopper architecture, FP8 GEMM suffers from limited accumulation precision. After aligning 32 mantissa products by right-shifting based on the maximum exponent, the Tensor Core only uses the highest 14 bits of each mantissa product for addition, and truncates bits exceeding this range. The accumulation of addition results into registers also employs 14-bit precision. Our implementation partially mitigates the limitation by accumulating the addition results of 128 FP8 ×FP8 multiplications into registers with FP32 precision in the CUDA core. Although helpful in achieving successful FP8 training, it is merely a compromise due to the Hopper architecture’s hardware deficiency in FP8 GEMM accumulation precision. Future chips need to adopt higher precision. Support for Tile- and Block-Wise Quantization. Current GPUs only support per-tensor quantization, lacking the native support for fine-grained quantization like our tile- and blockwise quantization. In the current implementation, when the NCinterval is reached, the partial results will be copied from Tensor Cores to CUDA cores, multiplied by the scaling factors, and added to FP32 registers on CUDA cores. Although the dequantization overhead is significantly mitigated combined with our precise FP32 accumulation strategy, the frequent data movements between Tensor Cores and CUDA cores still limit the computational efficiency. Therefore, we recommend future chips to support fine-grained quantization by enabling Tensor Cores to receive scaling factors and implement MMA with group scaling. In this way, the whole partial sum accumulation and dequantization can be completed directly inside Tensor Cores until the final result is produced, avoiding frequent data movements. Support for Online Quantization. The current implementations struggle to effectively support online quantization, despite its effectiveness demonstrated in our research. In the existing process, we need to read 128 BF16 activation values (the output of the previous computation) from HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) for quantization, and the quantized FP8 values are then written back to HBM, only to be read again for MMA. To address this inefficiency, we recommend that future chips integrate FP8 cast and TMA (Tensor Memory Accelerator) access into a single fused operation, so quantization can be completed during the transfer of activations from global memory to shared memory, avoiding frequent memory reads and writes. We also recommend supporting a warp-level cast instruction for speedup, which further facilitates the better fusion of layer normalization and FP8 cast. Alternatively, a near-memory computing approach can be adopted, where compute logic is placed near the HBM. In this case, BF16 elements can be cast to FP8 directly as they are read from HBM into the GPU, reducing off-chip memory access by roughly 50%. Support for Transposed GEMM Operations. The current architecture makes it cumbersome to fuse matrix transposition with GEMM operations. In our workflow, activations during the forward pass are quantized into 1x128 FP8 tiles and stored. During the backward pass, the matrix needs to be read out, dequantized, transposed, re-quantized into 128x1 tiles, and stored in HBM. To reduce memory operations, we recommend future chips to enable direct transposed reads of matrices from shared memory before MMA operation, for those precisions required in both training and inference. Combined with the fusion of FP8 format conversion and TMA access, this enhancement will significantly streamline the quantization workflow. 4. Pre-Training 4.1. Data Construction Compared with DeepSeek-V2, we optimize the pre-training corpus by enhancing the ratio of mathematical and programming samples, while expanding multilingual coverage beyond English and Chinese. Also, our data processing pipeline is refined to minimize redundancy while maintaining corpus diversity. Inspired by Ding et al. (2024), we implement the document packing method for data integrity but do not incorporate cross-sample attention masking during training. Finally, the training corpus for DeepSeek-V3 consists of 14.8T high-quality and diverse tokens in our tokenizer. In the training process of DeepSeekCoder-V2 (DeepSeek-AI, 2024a), we observe that the Fill-in-Middle (FIM) strategy does not compromise the next-token prediction capability while enabling the model to accurately predict middle text based on contextual cues. In alignment with DeepSeekCoder-V2, we also incorporate the FIM strategy in the pre-training of DeepSeek-V3. To be specific, we employ the Prefix-Suffix-Middle (PSM) framework to structure data as follows: <|fim_begin|> fpre<|fim_hole|> fsuf<|fim_end|> fmiddle <|eos_token|>. This structure is applied at the document level as a part of the pre-packing process. The FIM strategy is applied at a rate of 0.1, consistent with the PSM framework. The tokenizer for DeepSeek-V3 employs Byte-level BPE (Shibata et al., 1999) with an extended vocabulary of 128K tokens. The pretokenizer and training data for our tokenizer are modified to optimize multilingual compression efficiency. In addition, compared with DeepSeek-V2, the new pretokenizer introduces tokens that combine punctuations and line breaks. However, this trick may introduce the token boundary bias (Lundberg, 2023) when the model processes multi-line prompts without terminal line breaks, particularly for few-shot evaluation prompts. To address this issue, we randomly split a certain proportion of such combined tokens during training, which exposes the model to a wider array of special cases and mitigates this bias. 4.2. Hyper-Parameters Model Hyper-Parameters. We set the number of Transformer layers to 61 and the hidden dimension to 7168. All learnable parameters are randomly initialized with a standard deviation of 0.006. In MLA, we set the number of attention heads nhto 128 and the per-head dimension dh to 128. The KV compression dimension dcis set to 512, and the query compression dimension d′ c is set to 1536. For the decoupled queries and key, we set the per-head dimension dR hto 64. We substitute all FFNs except for the first three layers with MoE layers. Each MoE layer consists of 1 shared expert and 256 routed experts, where the intermediate hidden dimension of each expert is 2048. Among the routed experts, 8 experts will be activated for each token, and each token will be ensured to be sent to at most 4 nodes. The multi-token prediction depth Dis set to 1, i.e., besides the exact next token, each token will predict one additional token. As DeepSeek-V2, DeepSeek-V3 also employs additional RMSNorm layers after the compressed latent vectors, and multiplies additional scaling factors at the width bottlenecks. Under this configuration, DeepSeek-V3 comprises 671B total parameters, of which 37B are activated for each token. Training Hyper-Parameters. We employ the AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017) with hyper-parameters set to β1=0.9,β2=0.95, and weight_decay =0.1. We set the maximum sequence length to 4K during pre-training, and pre-train DeepSeek-V3 on 14.8T tokens. As for the learning rate scheduling, we first linearly increase it from 0 to 2.2×10−4during the first 2K steps. Then, we keep a constant learning rate of 2.2×10−4until the model consumes 10T training tokens. Subsequently, we gradually decay the learning rate to 2.2×10−5in 4.3T tokens, following a cosine decay curve. During the training of the final 500B tokens, we keep a constant learning rate of 2.2×10−5in the first 333B tokens, and switch to another constant learning rate of7.3×10−6in the remaining 167B tokens. The gradient clipping norm is set to 1.0. We employ a batch size scheduling strategy, where the batch size is gradually increased from 3072 to 15360 in the training of the first 469B tokens, and then keeps 15360 in the remaining training. We leverage pipeline parallelism to deploy different layers of a model on different GPUs, and for each layer, the routed experts will be uniformly deployed on 64 GPUs belonging to 8 nodes. As for the node-limited routing, each token will be sent to at most 4 nodes (i.e., M=4). For auxiliary-loss-free load balancing, we set the bias update speed γto 0.001 for the first 14.3T tokens, and to 0.0 for the remaining 500B tokens. For the balance loss, we set αto 0.0001, just to avoid extreme imbalance within any single sequence. The MTP loss weight λis set to 0.3 for the first 10T tokens, and to 0.1 for the remaining 4.8T tokens. 2K 11K 20K 29K 38K 47K 56K 65K 74K 83K 92K 101K 110K 119K 128K Context Length (#Tokens)0 100Document Depth Percent (%)Pressure Testing DeepSeek-V3 128K Context via "Needle In A HayStack" Score Figure 8|Evaluation results on the ”Needle In A Haystack” (NIAH) tests. DeepSeek-V3 performs well across all context window lengths up to 128K. 4.3. Long Context Extension We adopt a similar approach to DeepSeek-V2 (DeepSeek-AI, 2024c) to enable long context capabilities in DeepSeek-V3. After the pre-training stage, we apply YaRN (Peng et al., 2023a) for context extension and perform two additional training phases, each comprising 1000 steps, to progressively expand the context window from 4K to 32K and then to 128K. The YaRN configuration is consistent with that used in DeepSeek-V2, being applied exclusively to the decoupled shared key kR t. The hyper-parameters remain identical across both phases, with the scales=40,α=1,β=32, and the scaling factor√ t=0.1lns+1. In the first phase, the sequence length is set to 32K, and the batch size is 1920. During the second phase, the sequence length is increased to 128K, and the batch size is reduced to 480. The learning rate for both phases is set to 7.3×10−6, matching the final learning rate from the pre-training stage. Through this two-phase extension training, DeepSeek-V3 is capable of handling inputs up to 128K in length while maintaining strong performance. Figure 8 illustrates that DeepSeek-V3, following supervised fine-tuning, achieves notable performance on the "Needle In A Haystack" (NIAH) test, demonstrating consistent robustness across context window lengths up to 128K. 4.4. Evaluations 4.4.1. Evaluation Benchmarks The base model of DeepSeek-V3 is pretrained on a multilingual corpus with English and Chinese constituting the majority, so we evaluate its performance on a series of benchmarks primarily in English and Chinese, as well as on a multilingual benchmark.

In addition, we perform language-modeling-based evaluation for Pile-test and use Bits-Per-Byte (BPB) as the metric to guarantee fair comparison among models using different tokenizers. 4.4.2. Evaluation Results In Table 3, we compare the base model of DeepSeek-V3 with the state-of-the-art open-source base models, including DeepSeek-V2-Base (DeepSeek-AI, 2024c) (our previous release), Qwen2.5 72B Base (Qwen, 2024b), and LLaMA-3.1 405B Base (AI@Meta, 2024b).

All models are evaluated in our internal framework and share the same evaluation setting. Scores with a gap not exceeding 0.3 are considered to be at the same level. DeepSeek- V3-Base achieves the best performance on most benchmarks, especially on math and code tasks. of DeepSeek-V2-Base exhibits a slight difference from our previously reported results. Overall, DeepSeek-V3-Base comprehensively outperforms DeepSeek-V2-Base and Qwen2.5 72B Base, and surpasses LLaMA-3.1 405B Base in the majority of benchmarks, essentially becoming the strongest open-source model. From a more detailed perspective, we compare DeepSeek-V3-Base with the other open-source base models individually. (1) Compared with DeepSeek-V2-Base, due to the improvements in our model architecture, the scale-up of the model size and training tokens, and the enhancement of data quality, DeepSeek-V3-Base achieves significantly better performance as expected. (2) Compared with Qwen2.5 72B Base, the state-of-the-art Chinese open-source model, with only half of the activated parameters, DeepSeek-V3-Base also demonstrates remarkable advantages, especially on English, multilingual, code, and math benchmarks. As for Chinese benchmarks, except for CMMLU, a Chinese multi-subject multiple-choice task, DeepSeek-V3-Base also shows better performance than Qwen2.5 72B. (3) Compared with LLaMA-3.1 405B Base, the largest open-source model with 11 times the activated parameters, DeepSeek-V3-Base also exhibits much better performance on multilingual, code, and math benchmarks. As for English and Chinese language benchmarks, DeepSeek-V3-Base shows competitive or better performance, and is especially good on BBH, MMLU-series, DROP, C-Eval, CMMLU, and CCPM. Due to our efficient architectures and comprehensive engineering optimizations, DeepSeek- V3 achieves extremely high training efficiency. Under our training framework and infrastructures, training DeepSeek-V3 on each trillion tokens requires only 180K H800 GPU hours, which is much cheaper than training 72B or 405B dense models.

The MTP strategy consistently enhances the model performance on most of the evaluation benchmarks. 4.5. Discussion 4.5.1. Ablation Studies for Multi-Token Prediction In Table 4, we show the ablation results for the MTP strategy. To be specific, we validate the MTP strategy on top of two baseline models across different scales. At the small scale, we train a baseline MoE model comprising 15.7B total parameters on 1.33T tokens. At the large scale, we train a baseline MoE model comprising 228.7B total parameters on 540B tokens. On top of them, keeping the training data and the other architectures the same, we append a 1-depth MTP module onto them and train two models with the MTP strategy for comparison. Note that during inference, we directly discard the MTP module, so the inference costs of the compared models are exactly the same. From the table, we can observe that the MTP strategy consistently enhances the model performance on most of the evaluation benchmarks. 4.5.2. Ablation Studies for the Auxiliary-Loss-Free Balancing Strategy In Table 5, we show the ablation results for the auxiliary-loss-free balancing strategy. We validate this strategy on top of two baseline models across different scales. At the small scale, we train a baseline MoE model comprising 15.7B total parameters on 1.33T tokens. At the large scale, we train a baseline MoE model comprising 228.7B total parameters on 578B tokens.

Compared with the purely auxiliary-loss-based method, the auxiliary-loss-free strategy consistently achieves better model performance on most of the evaluation benchmarks. Both of the baseline models purely use auxiliary losses to encourage load balance, and use the sigmoid gating function with top-K affinity normalization. Their hyper-parameters to control the strength of auxiliary losses are the same as DeepSeek-V2-Lite and DeepSeek-V2, respectively. On top of these two baseline models, keeping the training data and the other architectures the same, we remove all auxiliary losses and introduce the auxiliary-loss-free balancing strategy for comparison. From the table, we can observe that the auxiliary-loss-free strategy consistently achieves better model performance on most of the evaluation benchmarks. 4.5.3. Batch-Wise Load Balance VS. Sequence-Wise Load Balance The key distinction between auxiliary-loss-free balancing and sequence-wise auxiliary loss lies in their balancing scope: batch-wise versus sequence-wise. Compared with the sequence-wise auxiliary loss, batch-wise balancing imposes a more flexible constraint, as it does not enforce in-domain balance on each sequence. This flexibility allows experts to better specialize in different domains. To validate this, we record and analyze the expert load of a 16B auxiliaryloss-based baseline and a 16B auxiliary-loss-free model on different domains in the Pile test set. As illustrated in Figure 9, we observe that the auxiliary-loss-free model demonstrates greater expert specialization patterns as expected. To further investigate the correlation between this flexibility and the advantage in model performance, we additionally design and validate a batch-wise auxiliary loss that encourages load balance on each training batch instead of on each sequence. The experimental results show that, when achieving a similar level of batch-wise load balance, the batch-wise auxiliary loss can also achieve similar model performance to the auxiliary-loss-free method. To be specific, in our experiments with 1B MoE models, the validation losses are: 2.258 (using a sequencewise auxiliary loss), 2.253 (using the auxiliary-loss-free method), and 2.253 (using a batch-wise auxiliary loss). We also observe similar results on 3B MoE models: the model using a sequencewise auxiliary loss achieves a validation loss of 2.085, and the models using the auxiliary-loss-free method or a batch-wise auxiliary loss achieve the same validation loss of 2.080. In addition, although the batch-wise load balancing methods show consistent performance advantages, they also face two potential challenges in efficiency: (1) load imbalance within 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758596061626364Wikipedia (en) Github DM MathematicsAux-Loss-Based Layer 9 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758596061626364Wikipedia (en) Github DM MathematicsAux-Loss-Free Layer 9 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758596061626364Wikipedia (en) Github DM MathematicsAux-Loss-Based Layer 18 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758596061626364Wikipedia (en) Github DM MathematicsAux-Loss-Free Layer 18 0 2 4 6 8 10Relative Expert LoadFigure 9|Expert load of auxiliary-loss-free and auxiliary-loss-based models on three domains in the Pile test set. The auxiliary-loss-free model shows greater expert specialization patterns than the auxiliary-loss-based one. The relative expert load denotes the ratio between the actual expert load and the theoretically balanced expert load. Due to space constraints, we only present the results of two layers as an example, with the results of all layers provided in Appendix C. certain sequences or small batches, and (2) domain-shift-induced load imbalance during inference. The first challenge is naturally addressed by our training framework that uses large-scale expert parallelism and data parallelism, which guarantees a large size of each micro-batch. For the second challenge, we also design and implement an efficient inference framework with redundant expert deployment, as described in Section 3.4, to overcome it. 5. Post-Training 5.1. Supervised Fine-T uning We curate our instruction-tuning datasets to include 1.5M instances spanning multiple domains, with each domain employing distinct data creation methods tailored to its specific requirements. Reasoning Data. For reasoning-related datasets, including those focused on mathematics, code competition problems, and logic puzzles, we generate the data by leveraging an internal DeepSeek-R1 model. Specifically, while the R1-generated data demonstrates strong accuracy, it suffers from issues such as overthinking, poor formatting, and excessive length. Our objective is to balance the high accuracy of R1-generated reasoning data and the clarity and conciseness of regularly formatted reasoning data. To establish our methodology, we begin by developing an expert model tailored to a specific domain, such as code, mathematics, or general reasoning, using a combined Supervised Fine- Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) training pipeline. This expert model serves as a data generator for the final model. The training process involves generating two distinct types of SFT samples for each instance: the first couples the problem with its original response in the format of <problem, original response>, while the second incorporates a system prompt alongside the problem and the R1 response in the format of <system prompt, problem, R1 response>. The system prompt is meticulously designed to include instructions that guide the model toward producing responses enriched with mechanisms for reflection and verification. During the RL phase, the model leverages high-temperature sampling to generate responses that integrate patterns from both the R1-generated and original data, even in the absence of explicit system prompts. After hundreds of RL steps, the intermediate RL model learns to incorporate R1 patterns, thereby enhancing overall performance strategically. Upon completing the RL training phase, we implement rejection sampling to curate highquality SFT data for the final model, where the expert models are used as data generation sources. This method ensures that the final training data retains the strengths of DeepSeek-R1 while producing responses that are concise and effective. Non-Reasoning Data. For non-reasoning data, such as creative writing, role-play, and simple question answering, we utilize DeepSeek-V2.5 to generate responses and enlist human annotators to verify the accuracy and correctness of the data. SFT Settings. We fine-tune DeepSeek-V3-Base for two epochs using the SFT dataset, using the cosine decay learning rate scheduling that starts at 5×10−6and gradually decreases to 1×10−6. During training, each single sequence is packed from multiple samples. However, we adopt a sample masking strategy to ensure that these examples remain isolated and mutually invisible. 5.2. Reinforcement Learning 5.2.1. Reward Model We employ a rule-based Reward Model (RM) and a model-based RM in our RL process. Rule-Based RM. For questions that can be validated using specific rules, we adopt a rulebased reward system to determine the feedback. For instance, certain math problems have deterministic results, and we require the model to provide the final answer within a designated format (e.g., in a box), allowing us to apply rules to verify the correctness. Similarly, for LeetCode problems, we can utilize a compiler to generate feedback based on test cases. By leveraging rule-based validation wherever possible, we ensure a higher level of reliability, as this approach is resistant to manipulation or exploitation. Model-Based RM. For questions with free-form ground-truth answers, we rely on the reward model to determine whether the response matches the expected ground-truth. Conversely, for questions without a definitive ground-truth, such as those involving creative writing, the reward model is tasked with providing feedback based on the question and the corresponding answer as inputs. The reward model is trained from the DeepSeek-V3 SFT checkpoints. To enhance its reliability, we construct preference data that not only provides the final reward but also includes the chain-of-thought leading to the reward. This approach helps mitigate the risk of reward hacking in specific tasks. 5.2.2. Group Relative Policy Optimization Similar to DeepSeek-V2 (DeepSeek-AI, 2024c), we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), which foregoes the critic model that is typically with the same size as the policy model, and estimates the baseline from group scores instead. Specifically, for each question q, GRPO samples a group of outputs {o1,o2,···,oG}from the old policy model πθoldand then optimizes the policy model πθby maximizing the following objective: JGRPO(θ)=E[q∼P(Q),{oi}G i=1∼πθold(O|q)] GG∑︁ i=1 minπθ(oi|q) πθold(oi|q)Ai, clipπθ(oi|q) πθold(oi|q), 1−ε, 1+ε Ai −βDKL  πθ||πref,(26) DKL  πθ||πref=πref(oi|q) πθ(oi|q)−logπref(oi|q) πθ(oi|q)−1, (27) whereεandβare hyper-parameters; πrefis the reference model; and Aiis the advantage, derived from the rewards {r1,r2,...,rG}corresponding to the outputs within each group: Ai=ri−mean({r1,r2,···,rG}) std({r1,r2,···,rG}). (28) We incorporate prompts from diverse domains, such as coding, math, writing, role-playing, and question answering, during the RL process. This approach not only aligns the model more closely with human preferences but also enhances performance on benchmarks, especially in scenarios where available SFT data are limited. 5.3. Evaluations 5.3.1. Evaluation Settings Evaluation Benchmarks. Apart from the benchmark we used for base model testing, we further evaluate instructed models on IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023), FRAMES (Krishna et al., 2024), LongBench v2 (Bai et al., 2024), GPQA (Rein et al., 2023), SimpleQA (OpenAI, 2024c), C- SimpleQA (He et al., 2024), SWE-Bench Verified (OpenAI, 2024d), Aider1, LiveCodeBench (Jain et al., 2024) (questions from August 2024 to November 2024), Codeforces2, Chinese National High School Mathematics Olympiad (CNMO 2024)3, and American Invitational Mathematics Examination 2024 (AIME 2024) (MAA, 2024). Compared Baselines. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of our chat model against several strong baselines, including DeepSeek-V2-0506, DeepSeek-V2.5-0905, Qwen2.5 72B Instruct, LLaMA-3.1 405B Instruct, Claude-Sonnet-3.5-1022, and GPT-4o-0513. For the DeepSeek-V2 model series, we select the most representative variants for comparison. For closed-source models, evaluations are performed through their respective APIs. Detailed Evaluation Configurations. For standard benchmarks including MMLU, DROP, GPQA, and SimpleQA, we adopt the evaluation prompts from the simple-evals framework4. We utilize the Zero-Eval prompt format (Lin, 2024) for MMLU-Redux in a zero-shot setting. For other datasets, we follow their original evaluation protocols with default prompts as provided by the dataset creators. For code and math benchmarks, the HumanEval-Mul dataset includes 8 mainstream programming languages (Python, Java, Cpp, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, and Bash) in total. We use CoT and non-CoT methods to evaluate model performance on LiveCodeBench, where the data are collected from August 2024 to November 2024. The Codeforces dataset is measured using the percentage of competitors. SWE-Bench verified is evaluated using the agentless framework (Xia et al., 2024). We use the “diff” format to evaluate the Aider-related benchmarks.

DeepSeek-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning DeepSeek-AI research@deepseek.com Abstract We introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. DeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrates remarkable reasoning capabilities. Through RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerges with numerous powerful and intriguing reasoning behaviors. However, it encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates multi-stage training and cold-start data before RL. DeepSeek- R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1-1217 on reasoning tasks. To support the research community, we open-source DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models (1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, 70B) distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Qwen and Llama.

Introduction In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been undergoing rapid iteration and evolution (Anthropic, 2024; Google, 2024; OpenAI, 2024a), progressively diminishing the gap towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Recently, post-training has emerged as an important component of the full training pipeline. It has been shown to enhance accuracy on reasoning tasks, align with social values, and adapt to user preferences, all while requiring relatively minimal computational resources against pre-training. In the context of reasoning capabilities, OpenAI’s o1 (OpenAI, 2024b) series models were the first to introduce inference-time scaling by increasing the length of the Chain-of- Thought reasoning process. This approach has achieved significant improvements in various reasoning tasks, such as mathematics, coding, and scientific reasoning. However, the challenge of effective test-time scaling remains an open question for the research community. Several prior works have explored various approaches, including process-based reward models (Lightman et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023), reinforcement learning (Kumar et al., 2024), and search algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search and Beam Search (Feng et al., 2024; Trinh et al., 2024; Xin et al., 2024). However, none of these methods has achieved general reasoning performance comparable to OpenAI’s o1 series models. In this paper, we take the first step toward improving language model reasoning capabilities using pure reinforcement learning (RL). Our goal is to explore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities without any supervised data, focusing on their self-evolution through a pure RL process. Specifically, we use DeepSeek-V3-Base as the base model and employ GRPO (Shao et al., 2024) as the RL framework to improve model performance in reasoning. During training, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors. After thousands of RL steps, DeepSeek-R1-Zero exhibits super performance on reasoning benchmarks. For instance, the pass@1 score on AIME 2024 increases from 15.6% to 71.0%, and with majority voting, the score further improves to 86.7%, matching the performance of OpenAI-o1-0912. However, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates a small amount of cold-start data and a multi-stage training pipeline. Specifically, we begin by collecting thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base model. Following this, we perform reasoning-oriented RL like DeepSeek-R1- Zero. Upon nearing convergence in the RL process, we create new SFT data through rejection sampling on the RL checkpoint, combined with supervised data from DeepSeek-V3 in domains such as writing, factual QA, and self-cognition, and then retrain the DeepSeek-V3-Base model. After fine-tuning with the new data, the checkpoint undergoes an additional RL process, taking into account prompts from all scenarios. After these steps, we obtained a checkpoint referred to as DeepSeek-R1, which achieves performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217. We further explore distillation from DeepSeek-R1 to smaller dense models. Using Qwen2.5- 32B (Qwen, 2024b) as the base model, direct distillation from DeepSeek-R1 outperforms applying RL on it. This demonstrates that the reasoning patterns discovered by larger base models are crucial for improving reasoning capabilities. We open-source the distilled Qwen and Llama (Dubey et al., 2024) series. Notably, our distilled 14B model outperforms state-of-the-art open-source QwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024a) by a large margin, and the distilled 32B and 70B models set a new record on the reasoning benchmarks among dense models. 1.1. Contributions Post-Training: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model •We directly apply RL to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek- R1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating long CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the first open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized purely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future advancements in this area. •We introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL stages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model’s reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities. We believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating better models. Distillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too •We demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered through RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit the research community to distill better smaller models in the future. •Using the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models that are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that the distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. DeepSeek- R1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves 55.5% on AIME 2024, surpassing QwQ-32B-Preview. Additionally, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B scores 72.6% on AIME 2024, 94.3% on MATH-500, and 57.2% on LiveCodeBench. These results significantly outperform previous opensource models and are comparable to o1-mini. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community. 1.2. Summary of Evaluation Results •Reasoning tasks: (1) DeepSeek-R1 achieves a score of 79.8% Pass@1 on AIME 2024, slightly surpassing OpenAI-o1-1217. On MATH-500, it attains an impressive score of 97.3%, performing on par with OpenAI-o1-1217 and significantly outperforming other models. (2) On coding-related tasks, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates expert level in code competition tasks, as it achieves 2,029 Elo rating on Codeforces outperforming 96.3% human participants in the competition. For engineering-related tasks, DeepSeek-R1 performs slightly better than DeepSeek-V3, which could help developers in real world tasks. •Knowledge: On benchmarks such as MMLU, MMLU-Pro, and GPQA Diamond, DeepSeek- R1 achieves outstanding results, significantly outperforming DeepSeek-V3 with scores of 90.8% on MMLU, 84.0% on MMLU-Pro, and 71.5% on GPQA Diamond. While its performance is slightly below that of OpenAI-o1-1217 on these benchmarks, DeepSeek-R1 surpasses other closed-source models, demonstrating its competitive edge in educational tasks. On the factual benchmark SimpleQA, DeepSeek-R1 outperforms DeepSeek-V3, demonstrating its capability in handling fact-based queries. A similar trend is observed where OpenAI-o1 surpasses 4o on this benchmark. •Others: DeepSeek-R1 also excels in a wide range of tasks, including creative writing, general question answering, editing, summarization, and more. It achieves an impressive length-controlled win-rate of 87.6% on AlpacaEval 2.0 and a win-rate of 92.3% on Are- naHard, showcasing its strong ability to intelligently handle non-exam-oriented queries. Additionally, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates outstanding performance on tasks requiring long-context understanding, substantially outperforming DeepSeek-V3 on long-context benchmarks. 2. Approach 2.1. Overview Previous work has heavily relied on large amounts of supervised data to enhance model performance. In this study, we demonstrate that reasoning capabilities can be significantly improved through large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), even without using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a cold start. Furthermore, performance can be further enhanced with the inclusion of a small amount of cold-start data. In the following sections, we present: (1) DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which applies RL directly to the base model without any SFT data, and (2) DeepSeek-R1, which applies RL starting from a checkpoint fine-tuned with thousands of long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) examples. 3) Distill the reasoning capability from DeepSeek-R1 to small dense models. 2.2. DeepSeek-R1-Zero: Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model Reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant effectiveness in reasoning tasks, as evidenced by our previous works (Shao et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023). However, these works heavily depended on supervised data, which are time-intensive to gather. In this section, we explore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities without any supervised data, focusing on their self-evolution through a pure reinforcement learning process. We start with a brief overview of our RL algorithm, followed by the presentation of some exciting results, and hope this provides the community with valuable insights. 2.2.1. Reinforcement Learning Algorithm Group Relative Policy Optimization In order to save the training costs of RL, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), which foregoes the critic model that is typically the same size as the policy model, and estimates the baseline from group scores instead. Specifically, for each question q, GRPO samples a group of outputs {o1,o2,···,oG}from the old policyπθoldand then optimizes the policy model πθby maximizing the following objective: JGRPO(θ)=E[q∼P(Q),{oi}G i=1∼πθold(O|q)] GG∑︁ i=1 minπθ(oi|q) πθold(oi|q)Ai, clipπθ(oi|q) πθold(oi|q), 1−ε, 1+ε Ai −βDKL  πθ||πref,(1) DKL  πθ||πref=πref(oi|q) πθ(oi|q)−logπref(oi|q) πθ(oi|q)−1, (2) whereεandβare hyper-parameters, and Aiis the advantage, computed using a group of rewards{r1,r2,...,rG}corresponding to the outputs within each group: Ai=ri−mean({r1,r2,···,rG}) std({r1,r2,···,rG}). (3) A conversation between User and Assistant. The user asks a question, and the Assistant solves it. The assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>. User: prompt. Assistant: Table 1|Template for DeepSeek-R1-Zero. prompt will be replaced with the specific reasoning question during training. 2.2.2. Reward Modeling The reward is the source of the training signal, which decides the optimization direction of RL. To train DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we adopt a rule-based reward system that mainly consists of two types of rewards: •Accuracy rewards: The accuracy reward model evaluates whether the response is correct. For example, in the case of math problems with deterministic results, the model is required to provide the final answer in a specified format (e.g., within a box), enabling reliable rule-based verification of correctness. Similarly, for LeetCode problems, a compiler can be used to generate feedback based on predefined test cases. •Format rewards: In addition to the accuracy reward model, we employ a format reward model that enforces the model to put its thinking process between ‘<think>’ and ‘</think>’ tags. We do not apply the outcome or process neural reward model in developing DeepSeek-R1-Zero, because we find that the neural reward model may suffer from reward hacking in the large-scale reinforcement learning process, and retraining the reward model needs additional training resources and it complicates the whole training pipeline. 2.2.3. Training Template To train DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we begin by designing a straightforward template that guides the base model to adhere to our specified instructions. As depicted in Table 1, this template requires DeepSeek-R1-Zero to first produce a reasoning process, followed by the final answer. We intentionally limit our constraints to this structural format, avoiding any content-specific biases—such as mandating reflective reasoning or promoting particular problem-solving strategies—to ensure that we can accurately observe the model’s natural progression during the RL process. 2.2.4. Performance, Self-evolution Process and Aha Moment of DeepSeek-R1-Zero Performance of DeepSeek-R1-Zero Figure 2 depicts the performance trajectory of DeepSeek- R1-Zero on the AIME 2024 benchmark throughout the RL training process. As illustrated, DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates a steady and consistent enhancement in performance as the RL training advances. Notably, the average pass@1 score on AIME 2024 shows a significant increase, jumping from an initial 15.6% to an impressive 71.0%, reaching performance levels comparable to OpenAI-o1-0912. This significant improvement highlights the efficacy of our RL algorithm in optimizing the model’s performance over time.

DeepSeek-Coder: When the Large Language Model Meets Programming - The Rise of Code Intelligence Daya Guo*1, Qihao Zhu∗1,2, Dejian Yang1, Zhenda Xie1, Kai Dong1, Wentao Zhang1 Guanting Chen1, Xiao Bi1, Y. Wu1, Y.K. Li1, Fuli Luo1, Yingfei Xiong2, Wenfeng Liang1 1DeepSeek-AI 2Key Lab of HCST (PKU), MOE; SCS, Peking University {zhuqh, guodaya}@deepseek.com Abstract The rapid development of large language models has revolutionized code intelligence in software development. However, the predominance of closed-source models has restricted extensive research and development. To address this, we introduce the DeepSeek-Coder series, a range of open-source code models with sizes from 1.3B to 33B, trained from scratch on 2 trillion tokens. These models are pre-trained on a high-quality project-level code corpus and employ a fill-in-the-blank task with a 16K window to enhance code generation and infilling. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that DeepSeek-Coder not only achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source code models across multiple benchmarks but also surpasses existing closed-source models like Codex and GPT-3.5. Furthermore, DeepSeek-Coder models are under a permissive license that allows for both research and unrestricted commercial use. Figure 1|The Performance of DeepSeek-Coder 1. Introduction The field of software development has been significantly transformed by the swift advancement of large language models (OpenAI, 2023; Touvron et al., 2023), which have brought about a new era of code intelligence. These models have the potential to automate and streamline many aspects of coding, from bug detection to code generation, thereby enhancing productivity and reducing the likelihood of human error. However, a major challenge in this field is the performance gap between open-source models (Li et al., 2023; Nijkamp et al., 2022; Roziere et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2021) and closed-source models (Gemini Team, 2023; OpenAI, 2023). The giant closed-source models, while powerful, are often inaccessible to many researchers and developers due to their proprietary nature. In response to this challenge, we present the DeepSeek-Coder series. This series comprises a range of open-source code models, varying in size from 1.3B to 33B, including the base version and instructed version for each size. Each model in the series has been trained from scratch on 2 trillion tokens sourced from 87 programming languages, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of coding languages and syntax. Besides, we attempt to organize the pretraining data at the repository level to enhance the pre-trained model’s understanding capability within the context of cross-files within a repository. In addition to employing the next token prediction loss during pre-training, we have also incorporated the Fill-In-Middle (FIM) approach (Bavarian et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023). This approach is designed to further bolster the model’s code completion capabilities. To meet the requirements of handling longer code inputs, we have extended the context length to 16K. This adjustment allows our models to handle more complex and extensive coding tasks, thereby increasing their versatility and applicability in various coding scenarios. We have carried out comprehensive experiments using a variety of public code-related benchmarks. The findings reveal that among open-source models, DeepSeek-Coder-Base 33B consistently delivers superior performance across all benchmarks. Furthermore, DeepSeek- Coder-Instruct 33B surpasses OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo in the majority of the evaluation benchmarks, significantly narrowing the performance gap between OpenAI GPT-4 and open-source models. Remarkably, despite having fewer parameters, DeepSeek-Coder-Base 7B demonstrates competitive performance when compared to models that are five times larger, such as CodeLlama-33B (Roziere et al., 2023). To summarize, our main contributions are: •We introduce DeepSeek-Coder-Base and DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct, our advanced codefocused large language models (LLMs). Developed through extensive training on an expansive code corpus, these models exhibit proficiency in understanding 87 programming languages. Additionally, they are available in various model scales to cater to a wide range of computational and application needs. •We make the first attempt to incorporate repository-level data construction during the pre-training phase of our models. We find that it can significantly boost the capability of cross-file code generation. •Our analysis rigorously examines the impact of FIM training strategies on the pretraining phase of code models. The outcomes of these comprehensive studies shed light on intriguing aspects of FIM configurations, offering valuable insights that significantly contribute to the enhancement and development of code pretrained models. •We conduct extensive evaluations of our code LLMs against a wide array of benchmarks encompassing numerous code-related tasks. The findings demonstrate that DeepSeek-Coder- Base surpasses all existing open-source code LLMs across these benchmarks. Furthermore, with meticulous fine-tuning using instructional data, DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct achieves better performance compared to the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model in code-related tasks. 2. Data Collection The training dataset of DeepSeek-Coder is composed of 87% source code, 10% English coderelated natural language corpus, and 3% code-unrelated Chinese natural language corpus. The English corpus consists of materials from GitHub’s Markdown and StackExchange1, which are used to enhance the model’s understanding of code-related concepts and improve its ability to handle tasks like library usage and bug fixing. Meanwhile, the Chinese corpus consists of high-quality articles aimed at improving the model’s proficiency in understanding the Chinese language. In this section, we will provide an overview of how we construct the code training data. This process involves data crawling, rule-based filtering, dependency parsing, repositorylevel deduplication, and quality screening, as illustrated in Figure 2. In the following, we will describe the data creation procedure step by step. Rule FilteringDependency ParsingRepo-level Deduplication Quality ScreeningData Crawling Figure 2|The Procedure of Dataset Creation 2.1. GitHub Data Crawling and Filtering We collect public repositories created before February 2023 on GitHub and retain only 87 programming languages, as listed in Table 1. To reduce the amount of data to be processed, we apply filtering rules similar to those used in the StarCoder project (Li et al., 2023) to preliminarily filter out lower-quality code. By applying these filtering rules, we reduce the total amount of data to only 32.8% of its original size. To make the paper self-contained, we briefly describe the filter rules used in the StarCoder Data project: Firstly, we filter out files with an average line length exceeding 100 characters or a maximum line length surpassing 1000 characters. Additionally, we remove files with fewer than 25% alphabetic characters. Except for the XSLT programming language, we further filter out files where the string "<?xml version=" appeared in the first 100 characters. For HTML files, we consider the ratio of visible text to HTML code. We retain files where the visible text constitutes at least 20% of the code and is no less than 100 characters. For JSON and YAML files, which typically contain more data, we only keep files that have a character count ranging from 50 to 5000 characters. This effectively removes most data-heavy files. 2.2. Dependency Parsing In previous works (Chen et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023; Nijkamp et al., 2022; Roziere et al., 2023), large language models for code are mainly pre-trained on file-level source code, which ignores the dependencies between different files in a project. However, in practical applications, such models struggle to effectively scale to handle entire project-level code scenarios. Therefore, we

Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 GLM-130B: A NOPEN BILINGUAL PRE-TRAINED MODEL Aohan Zeng⋄†∗, Xiao Liu⋄†∗, Zhengxiao Du⋄†, Zihan Wang⋄, Hanyu Lai⋄, Ming Ding⋄, Zhuoyi Yang⋄, Yifan Xu⋄, Wendi Zheng⋄, Xiao Xia⋄, Weng Lam Tam⋄§, Zixuan Ma⋄, Yufei Xue§, Jidong Zhai⋄, Wenguang Chen⋄, Peng Zhang§, Yuxiao Dong⋄‡, Jie Tang⋄‡ Tsinghua University⋄Zhipu.AI§ ABSTRACT We introduce GLM-130B, a bilingual (English and Chinese) pre-trained language model with 130 billion parameters. It is an attempt to open-source a 100B-scale model at least as good as GPT-3 (davinci) and unveil how models of such a scale can be successfully pre-trained. Over the course of this effort, we face numerous unexpected technical and engineering challenges, particularly on loss spikes and divergence. In this paper, we introduce the training process of GLM-130B including its design choices, training strategies for both efficiency and stability, and engineering efforts. The resultant GLM-130B model offers significant outperformance over GPT-3 175B (davinci) on a wide range of popular English benchmarks while the performance advantage is not observed in OPT-175B and BLOOM-176B. It also consistently and significantly outperforms ERNIE TITAN 3.0 260B—the largest Chinese language model—across related benchmarks. Finally, we leverage a unique scaling property of GLM-130B to reach INT4 quantization without post training, with almost no performance loss, making it the first among 100B-scale models and more importantly, allowing its effective inference on 4×RTX 3090 (24G) or 8 ×RTX 2080 Ti (11G) GPUs, the most affordable GPUs required for using 100B-scale models. The GLM-130B model weights are publicly accessible and its code, training logs, related toolkit, and lessons learned 1 I NTRODUCTION Large language models (LLMs), particularly those with over 100 billion (100B) parameters (Brown et al., 2020; Thoppilan et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2021), have presented attractive scaling laws (Wei et al., 2022b), where emergent zero-shot and few-shot capabilities suddenly arose. Among them, GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) with 175B parameters pioneers the study of 100B-scale LLMs by strikingly generating better performance with 32 labeled examples than the fully-supervised BERT-Large model on a variety of benchmarks. However, both GPT-3 (and many other closed-sourced 100B-scale ones)—the model itself—and how it can be trained, have been thus far intransparent to the public. It is of critical value to train a high-quality LLM of such scale with both the model and training process shared with everyone. We thus aim to pre-train an open and highly-accurate 100B-scale model with ethical concerns in mind. Over the course of our attempt, we have come to realize that pre-training a dense LLM at such a scale raises numerous unexpected technical and engineering challenges compared to training 10B-scale models, in terms of pre-training efficiency, stability, and convergence. Similar difficulties have also been concurrently observed in training OPT-175B (Zhang et al., 2022) and BLOOM- 176B (Scao et al., 2022), further demonstrating the significance of GPT-3 as a pioneer study. *The two lead authors AZ and XL contributed equally ({zengaohan,shawliu9}@gmail.com) †Work partially done when AZ, XL, and ZD interned at Zhipu.AI. ‡Team leads: YD and JT.

However, replicating such advancements in open-source models has been challenging. This paper introduces InternLM2, an open-source LLM that outperforms its predecessors in comprehensive evaluations across 6 dimensions and 30 benchmarks, long-context modeling, and open-ended subjective evaluations through innovative pre-training and optimization techniques. The pre-training process of InternLM2 is meticulously detailed, highlighting the preparation of diverse data types including text, code, and long-context data. InternLM2 efficiently captures long-term dependencies, initially trained on 4k tokens before advancing to 32k tokens in pre-training and fine-tuning stages, exhibiting remarkable performance on the 200k “Needle-in-a-Haystack” test. InternLM2 is further aligned using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and a novel Conditional Online Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (COOL RLHF) strategy that addresses conflicting human preferences and reward hacking. By releasing InternLM2 models in different training stages and model sizes, we provide the community with insights into the model’s evolution.

Models trained on billions of tokens have demonstrated profound empathy and problem-solving capabilities, leading to widespread speculation that the era of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) may soon be upon us. Despite this enthusiasm, the path to developing models with capabilities comparable to those of ChatGPT or GPT-4 remains elusive. The open-source community has been working diligently to bridge the gap between proprietary LLMs and their open-source counterparts. In the past year, several notable open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Qwen (Bai et al., 2023a), Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023), and Deepseek (Bi et al., 2024), have made significant strides. In this paper, we introduce InternLM2, a new Large Language Model that outperforms the previously mentioned models. The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) encompasses several main phases: pretraining, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) (Ouyang et al., 2022). Pre-training is chiefly based on leveraging a vast corpus of natural text, amassing trillions of tokens. This phase is aimed at equipping LLMs with a broad repository of knowledge and fundamental skills. The quality of data is considered the most crucial factor during pre-training. However, technical reports on LLMs (Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Bai et al., 2023a; Bi et al., 2024) in the past have seldom addressed the processing of pre-training data. InternLM2 extensively details how it prepares text, code, and long-context data for pre-training. How to effectively extend the context length of LLMs is currently a hot research topic, since many downstream applications, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) (Gao et al., 2023) and agents (Xi et al., 2023), rely on long contexts. InternLM2 first employs Group Query Attention (GQA) to enable a smaller memory footprint when inferring long sequences. In the pre-training phase, we initially train InternLM2 with 4k context texts, then transit the training corpus to high-quality 32k texts for further training. Upon completion, through positional encoding extrapolation (LocalLLaMA, 2023), InternLM2 achieves commendable performance in the “Needle-in-a-Haystack” test within 200k contexts. Following long-context pre-training, we utilize supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to ensure the model adheres well to human instructions and aligns with human values. Notably, we also construct corresponding 32k data during these processes to further improve the long-context processing capability of InternLM2. Besides, we introduce COnditional OnLine RLHF (COOL RLHF), which adopts a conditional reward model to reconcile diverse but potentially conflicting preferences and executes Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) over multiple rounds to mitigate emerging reward hacking in each phase. To elucidate the impact of RLHF within the community, we also release models in their pre- and post-RLHF stages, named InternLM2-Chat- {size}-SFT and InternLM2-Chat- {size}, respectively. Our contributions are twofold, highlighting not only the model’s exceptional performance across diverse benchmarks but also our comprehensive approach to its development in different stages. Key points include 1.Open-Sourcing InternLM2 with Exceptional Performance: We have open-sourced models of various sizes, including 1.8B, 7B, and 20B, all of which perform well in both subjective and objective evaluations. Additionally, we have released models from different stages to facilitate community analysis of changes post-SFT and RLHF training. 2.Designed with a 200k Context Window: InternLM2 exhibits impressive longcontext performance, nearly perfectly identifying all “needles” in the “Needle-in-a- Haystack” experiment with a 200k context. Furthermore, we provide experience of training long-context LLMs across all stages, including pretraining, SFT, and RLHF. 3.Comprehensive Data Preparation Guidance: We have elaborated on the preparation of data for LLMs, including pre-training data, domain-specific enhancement data, SFT data, and RLHF data. These details will benefit the community in better training of LLMs. 4.Innovative RLHF Training Techniques: We introduced Conditional Online RLHF (COOL RLHF) to harmonize various preferences, significantly enhancing the performance of InternLM2 in various subjective dialogue evaluations. We have also conducted a preliminary analysis and comparison of RLHF’s subjective and objective results to offer the community insights into RLHF. 2 Infrastructure In this part, we introduce the training framework InternEvo which was used during pretraining, SFT and RLHF. 2.1 InternEvo We utilize InternEvo, an efficient and lightweight pretraining framework, for model training. This framework enables us to scale model training across thousands of GPUs. This is achieved through a combination of data, tensor (Shoeybi et al., 2019), sequence (Korthikanti et al., 2023), and pipeline (Huang et al., 2019) parallelism. To further enhance GPU memory efficiency, InternEvo incorporates various Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO) (Rajbhandari et al., 2020) strategies, significantly reducing the memory footprint required for training. In addition, to enhance hardware utilization, we incorporate the FlashAttention technique (Dao, 2023) and mixed-precision training (Narang et al., 2017) with BF16. InternEvo demonstrates strong scaling performance when training InternLM across thousands of GPUs. As shown in Figure 1, when training InternLM-7B on 8 GPUs with a global batch size of 4 million tokens, InternEvo achieves 64% Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU). Scaling up the training to 1024 GPUs, InternEvo maintains an impressive 53% MFU with the same global batch size. This level of scaling performance is particularly challenging to attain, as the batch size remains constant and the computation-to-communication ratio decreases with an increased number of GPUs. In contrast, DeepSpeed (Rasley et al., 2020) only manages to achieve around 36% MFU when training the InternLM-7B on 1024 GPUs using ZeRO-1 (Rajbhandari et al., 2020) and MiCS (Zhang et al., 2022). InternEvo also exhibits strong scaling of sequence length, supporting 256, 000 tokens when training LLMs of varying sizes. For instance, when training the InternLM-7B model with a sequence length of 256, 000 tokens, InternEvo can achieve nearly 88% MFU. In comparison, DeepSpeed-Ulysses and Megatron-LM only reach about 65% MFU. This improvement in training performance is also observed with LLMs of larger sizes, such as models with 30 billion or 70 billion parameters. 00.20.40.60.8 8321285121024MFUGPUNumber00.20.40.60.8 16K32K64K128K256KMFUSequence LengthFigure 1: Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) of training InternLM-7B with InternEvo. We benchmark training performance using a sequence length of 4096 tokens with varying GPU numbers, and benchmark training performance on 128 GPUs with varying sequence lengths. Reducing Communication Overhead A trade-off exists between memory utilization and communication cost in distributed LLM training. Initially, the communication cost can be effectively reduced by diminishing the communication scale. This involves limiting communications to a smaller group of GPUs, potentially within the same node, which mitigates the overall communication cost. Building upon this principle, InternEvo addresses communication challenges by implementing a suite of adaptive sharding techniques to achieve strong scaling performance (Chen et al., 2024b). These include Full-Replica, Full-Sharding, and Partial-Sharding, which allow each component of the model states—parameters, gradients, and optimizer states—to independently select the most appropriate sharding approach and device mesh configuration. This flexibility facilitates a more nuanced distribution of model states across the GPU infrastructure. InternEvo also introduces an optimization framework designed to identify the most efficient sharding factors. This aims to minimize communication expenses while adhering to the memory constraints of the GPU. Communication-Computation Overlap Further reducing communication overhead, In- ternEvo strategically coordinates communication and computation to optimize overall system performance. When employing parameter sharding, the model’s entire parameters are distributed across multiple GPUs to conserve GPU memory. During each forward and backward pass of every micro-batch in a training step, InternEvo efficiently pre-fetches the complete parameter set for upcoming layers through AllGather, while concurrently computing the current layer. The generated gradients undergo synchronization within the parameter sharding group through ReduceScatter and are subsequently synchronized across parameter sharding groups using AllReduce. These communication processes are skillfully overlapped with the backward computation, maximizing efficiency in the training pipeline. In the case of optimizer state sharding, where the GPU broadcasts updated parameters within the sharding group through Broadcast, InternEvo employs a strategic overlap with the forward computation of the next training step. These innovative overlap approaches effectively balance communication overhead and computation execution time, resulting in a significant enhancement in overall system performance. Long-Sequence Training One of the primary challenges in long-sequence training is the trade-off between computation speed and communication overhead. InternEvo breaks down GPU memory management into a hierarchical space with four parallel dimensions—data, tensor, sequence, and pipeline—and three sharding dimensions—parameter, gradient, and optimizer state (Chen et al., 2024a). We conduct a thorough analysis of memory and communication costs for each dimension, utilizing an execution simulator to identify and implement the optimal parallelization strategy. The optimal execution plan can be automatically searched based on the training scale, sequence length, model size, and batch size. With this execution plan, InternEvo exhibits the capability to handle long contexts (up to 1 million tokens) during training. InternEvo also implements memory management techniques to reduce GPU memory fragmentation, a common issue in long-sequence training scenarios. It uses a memory pool for unified memory management and introduces a defragmentation technique that proactively consolidates small memory chunks to prevent out-of-memory errors. Fault Tolerance We have also addressed the challenges of efficiently training LLMs in GPU datacenters, which often face issues such as frequent hardware failures, complex parallelization strategies, and imbalanced resource utilization. To tackle these issues, we conducted an in-depth characterization study of a six-month LLM development workload trace from our GPU datacenter (Hu et al., 2024). This study identified discrepancies between LLMs and previous deep learning workloads and explored resource utilization patterns and job failure impacts. Based on our analysis, we introduced two system efforts: a faulttolerant pretraining system that enhances fault tolerance through LLM-involved failure diagnosis and automatic recovery, and a decoupled scheduling system for evaluation tasks that provides timely model performance feedback. In our implementation, we have incorporated an asynchronous saving mechanism that regularly archives model weights and optimizer states to distributed file and object storage at predefined intervals. Throughout the training process, each GPU first saves its model states in local storage and subsequently asynchronously uploads this data to the remote distributed storage system. This dual-step process ensures that, in the event of occasional hardware or network failures automatically detected by our system, only a minimal amount of training progress is lost. To optimize storage space, we systematically transfer these temporary model checkpoints from hot storage to cost-effective cold storage. Furthermore, our system is designed to seamlessly resume model training even when the parallelization configuration is altered, providing flexibility and continuity in the training pipeline. Interactive Training The efficiency of InternEvo has also been successfully demonstrated in the Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) stage, where multiple LLMs are deployed for interactive training. For instance, in the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) process, we utilize four equally-sized models and train two of them; InternEvo enables each model to be executed at its optimal configuration. To enhance the coordination of multiple models, we have developed an innovative RLHF framework that builds upon InternEvo and Ray. This framework is characterized by its flexibility and scalability, allowing it to perform effectively at scale. It is capable of integrating with various LLM execution engines and supporting diverse algorithmic designs. For a comprehensive description of the ”Alignment” concept, please refer to Section 4. 2.2 Model Structure Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) has been predominantly used as the backbone for past Large Language Models (LLMs) due to its excellent parallelization capabilities, which fully leverage the power of GPUs (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2023; Zeng et al., 2023). LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a) builds on Transformer architecture by replacing LayerNorm (Ba et al., 2016) with RMSNorm (Zhang & Sennrich, 2019) and setting the activation function to SwiGLU (Shazeer, 2020), resulting in improved training efficiency and performance. Since the unveiling of LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), the community has vigorously engaged in augmenting the ecosystem built around the LLaMA architecture. This includes advancements in high-efficiency inference (lla, 2023) and operator optimization (Dao, 2023), among others. To ensure our model, InternLM2, aligns seamlessly with this well-established ecosystem, alongside other renowned LLMs, such as Falcon (Almazrouei et al., 2023), Qwen (Bai et al., 2023a), Baichuan (Yang et al., 2023), Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023), we opt to adhere to the structural design principles of LLaMA. In pursuit of enhancing efficiency, we consolidate the Wk,Wq, and Wvmatrices, which has resulted in a training acceleration of over 5% during the pre-training phase. Moreover, to better support diverse tensor parallelism (tp) transformations, we have reconfigured the matrix layout. Rather than stacking the Wk,Wq, and Wvmatrices in a straightforward manner, we adopt an interleaving approach for each head’s Wk,Wq, and Wv, as depicted in Figure 2. This design modification facilitates the adjustment of the tensor parallel size through either splitting or concatenating the matrices along their last dimension, thereby enhancing the model’s flexibility in varying distributed computing environments. InternLM2 aims to infer beyond 32K context, there- InternLMWqkv (TP=1)InternLM2Wqkv (TP=1)defsplit_wqkv_with_tp(Wqkv, tp_size, num_q_per_kv, num_heads):"""Split wqkvwith tensor parallelism in InternLM."""hsz, num_cols=Wqkv.shapec_size=num_cols//(num_q_per_kv+2)head_size=c_size//num_headsWq=Wqkv[:c_size*num_q_per_kv]Wk=Wqkv[c_size* num_q_per_kv:c_size* (num_q_per_kv+1)]Wv=Wqkv[-c_size:]Wqkvs=[]foriinrange(tp_size):_Wq=Wq[head_size* num_q_per_kv* i:head_size* num_q_per_kv*(i+1)]_Wk=Wk[head_size*i: head_size*(i+1)]_Wv=Wv[head_size*i: head_size*(i+1)]_Wqkv=torch.cat([_Wq, _Wk, _Wv], dim=0)Wqkvs.append(_Wqkv)returnWqkvsdefsplit_wqkv_with_tp(Wqkv, tp_size):"""Split wqkvwith tensor parallelism in InternLM2."""returntorch.split(Wqkv, split_size_or_sections=tp_size, dim=0)Figure 2: Different weight matrix layouts cause different complexity when changing the tensor parallelism (TP) size. fore, InternLM2 series models all choose Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) (Ainslie et al., 2023), so that it can infer both in high speed and low GPU memory with very long contexts. 3 Pre-train We introduce pre-training data, pre-training settings, and three pre-training phases in this part. 3.1 Pre-training data The pre-training of LLMs is critically shaped by data, which presents a multifaceted challenge. It encompasses handling sensitive data, covering comprehensive knowledge, and balancing efficiency and quality. In this section, we will depict our data processing pipeline for preparing general domain textual data, programming language-related data, and long textual data. 3.1.1 Text Data The text data in our pre-training dataset can be categorized by source into web pages, papers, patents, and books. To transform these sources into a pre-training dataset, we first standardize all data into a specified format, categorize them by type and language, and store them in JSON Lines (jsonl) format. Then, for all data, we apply several processing steps including rule-based filtering, data deduplication, safety filtering, and quality filtering. This results in a rich, safe, and high-quality text dataset. Data Source Distribution We have statistically analyzed the number of documents, data storage size, and data Bytes proportion in the pre-training dataset according to their sources, as shown in Table 1. Among them, the Chinese and English data from web pages account for 86.46% of the total, making it the primary source. Although the data volume from other sources is relatively small, such as books and technical literature(abbreviated as techlit), the average document length is longer and the content quality is relatively higher, making them equally important. Data Process Pipeline The data processing pipeline used in this work is shown in Figure 3. The entire data processing pipeline first standardizes data from different sources to obtain Format data. Then, heuristic statistical rules are used for data filtering to get Clean data.

In this work, we delve into the relationship between model scaling and performance, systematically exploring the performance trends in vision encoders, language models, dataset sizes, and testtime configurations. Through extensive evaluations on a wide range of benchmarks, including multi-discipline reasoning, document understanding, multi-image / video understanding, realworld comprehension, multimodal hallucination detection, visual grounding, multilingual capabilities, and pure language processing, InternVL 2.5 exhibits competitive performance, rivaling leading commercial models such as GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet. Notably, our model is the first open-source MLLMs to surpass 70% on the MMMU benchmark, achieving a 3.7-point improvement through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and showcasing strong spaces/OpenGVLab/InternVL 1 Introduction In recent years, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) [ 60,137,246,36,35,248,140,228,192,275,143, 54,170] have emerged as a pivotal technology in artificial intelligence, capable of processing and understanding information from multiple modalities such as text, images, and videos. These models promise breakthroughs across fields like natural language processing, computer vision, and human-computer interaction. However, developing large-scale MLLMs remains a challenging task, requiring significant computational resources, sophisticated architectures, and the ability to effectively integrate diverse data types in a scalable manner. Various attempts have been made to address these challenges, including enhancing model architectures [ 220, 232,5,172,157,210], scaling vision encoders [ 252,66,36,293,185] and language models [ 231,235,64, 19,229,221,62], incorporating more diverse and high-quality datasets [ 124,234,25,155], and refining the test-time scaling process [ 215,249,230] to boost performance.

InternVL 2.5 showcases strong multimodal capabilities, rivaling closed-source models like GPT-4o [ 192] and Claude-3.5-Sonnet [ 8]. However, since the OpenCompass score is derived from 8 academic VQA benchmarks and covers only a subset of overall capabilities, we still need further effort to match the performance with closed-source models. and accessibility, leaving gaps in the open-source community. While open-source multimodal models such as the InternVL series [ 36,35,71] and Qwen-VL series [ 13,246] have provided high-performance, transparent alternatives, they still fall short in terms of achieving the desired levels of performance and efficiency. In this work, we introduce InternVL 2.5, an advanced large-scale MLLM series that builds upon the foundational architecture of InternVL 2.0. Continuing the objectives of the entire InternVL series, we aim to bridge the performance gap between commercial closed-source models and open-source multimodal models. In InternVL 2.5, we systematically explore various factors in MLLM, including how changes in vision encoders, language models, dataset sizes, and inference times affect the overall performance of the model, demonstrating the relationship between scaling and performance in multimodal models. Specifically, we have some interesting findings: (1) Large vision encoders significantly reduce the dependency on training data when scaling up MLLMs. As shown in Table 3, compared to Qwen2-VL-72B [ 246] equipped with a 600M vision encoder, our InternVL2.5- 78B with a 6B vision encoder can achieve better performance using only 1/10 of the training tokens. This greatly reduces the exploration cost when scaling up MLLMs; (2) Data quality matters. Upgrading InternVL from 2.0 to 2.5 doubled the dataset size, but strict filtering greatly improved quality. For example, we carefully excluded the anomalous samples (e.g., repetitive patterns), achieving substantial improvements in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning tasks such as MMMU [ 289] and complex challenges like the OlympiadBench [ 80]. Note that, most existing open-source MLLMs tend to underperform when using CoT [ 249]. (3) Test-time scaling is beneficial for difficult multimodal QA. For challenging tasks such as MMMU, the InternVL2.5-78B with CoT reaches 70.1%, which is 3.7 points higher than the direct response. Subsequently, we have successfully verified that CoT can be further combined with majority voting and bring additional improvements. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) We release InternVL 2.5 to the open-source community, providing a powerful tool for the development and application of multimodal AI systems and encouraging further research in this domain. (2) We investigate how scaling different components of the MLLMs such as vision encoders, language models, dataset sizes, and inference time affect performance. (3) Through extensive evaluations on diverse benchmarks—including multi-discipline reasoning, document understanding, multi-image / video understanding, real-world comprehension, multimodal hallucination detection, visual grounding, multilingual capabilities, and pure language processing—InternVL 2.5 exhibits competitive performance, rivaling leading commercial models like GPT-4o [ 192] and Claude-3.5-Sonnet [ 8].

InternVL 2.5 retains the same model architecture as InternVL 1.5 [ 35] and InternVL 2.0, i.e.the widely-used “ViT-MLP-LLM” paradigm, which combines a pre-trained InternViT-300M or InternViT-6B with LLMs [ 19,229] of various sizes via an MLP projector. Consistent with previous versions, we apply a pixel unshuffle operation to reduce the 1024 visual tokens produced by each 448 ×448 image tile to 256 tokens. Moreover, compared to InternVL 1.5, InternVL 2.0 and 2.5 introduced additional data types, incorporating multi-image and video data alongside the existing single-image and text-only data. first open-source MLLM to surpass 70% on the MMMU validation set [ 289], setting a new benchmark and highlighting the potential of open-source solutions in advancing multimodal AI. 2 Model Architecture 2.1 Overall Architecture As shown in Figure 2 and Table 2, InternVL 2.5 retains the same model architecture as its predecessors, InternVL 1.5 [ 35] and InternVL 2.0, following the “ViT-MLP-LLM” paradigm widely adopted in various MLLM studies [150, 151, 36, 316, 162, 246, 124, 256]. In this new version, our implementation of this architecture integrates a newly incrementally pre-trained InternViT-6B or InternViT-300M with various pre-trained LLMs of different sizes and types, including InternLM 2.5 [19] and Qwen 2.5 [ 229], using a randomly initialized 2-layer MLP projector. As in the previous version, to enhance scalability for high-resolution processing, we simply applied a pixel unshuffle operation, reducing the number of visual tokens to one-quarter of the original. Consequently, in our model, a 448 ×448 image tile is represented by 256 visual tokens. In terms of input data preprocessing, we adopted a similar dynamic resolution strategy as InternVL 1.5, dividing images into tiles of 448 ×448 pixels based on the aspect ratio and resolution of the input images. The key difference, starting from InternVL 2.0, is that we additionally introduced support for multi-image and video data, as shown in Figure 2(b). Different data types correspond to different preprocessing configurations, which we will detail in Section 3.1. 2.2 Vision Encoder InternVL employs InternViT [ 36] as the vision encoder. To better document the training progression of InternViT, we have provided detailed information in Table 1. InternViT currently has two different model sizes, including InternViT-6B and InternViT-300M. InternViT-6B. InternViT-6B-224px was first introduced in our CVPR paper [ 36], and its structure follows the vanilla ViT [ 61], with minor adjustments incorporating QK-Norm [ 53] and RMSNorm [ 294]. It had 5.9B parameters, 48 layers, a hidden size of 3200, and 25 heads, and it was trained using a contrastive loss [ 195]. Due to the limited gains at that time, we adopted an incremental pre-training strategy to continuously refine its weights. Specifically, we connected InternViT-6B to an LLM via an MLP projector and, following a brief MLP warmup, jointly trained the InternViT-6B using a next token prediction loss (as shown in Figure 4(a)) to enhance its visual feature extraction capabilities. In the V1.0 and V1.2 versions, we used a fixed resolution of 448 ×448 for training, but in later versions, we switched to dynamic resolution training to improve high-resolution Model Name Train Res.

Phi-3 Technical Report: A Highly Capable Language Model Locally on Your Phone Microsoft Abstract We introduce phi-3-mini, a 3.8 billion parameter language model trained on 3.3 trillion tokens, whose overall performance, as measured by both academic benchmarks and internal testing, rivals that of models such as Mixtral 8x7B and GPT-3.5 (e.g., phi-3-mini achieves 69% on MMLU and 8.38 on MT-bench), despite being small enough to be deployed on a phone. Our training dataset is a scaled-up version of the one used for phi-2, composed of heavily filtered publicly available web data and synthetic data. The model is also further aligned for robustness, safety, and chat format. We also provide parameter-scaling results with a 7B, 14B models trained for 4.8T tokens, called phi- 3-small,phi-3-medium, both significantly more capable than phi-3-mini (e.g., respectively 75%, 78% on MMLU, and 8.7, 8.9 on MT-bench). To enhance multilingual, multimodal, and long-context capabilities, we introduce three models in the phi-3.5 series: phi-3.5-mini,phi-3.5-MoE, and phi- 3.5-Vision. The phi-3.5-MoE, a 16 x 3.8B MoE model with 6.6 billion active parameters, achieves superior performance in language reasoning, math, and code tasks compared to other open-source models of similar scale, such as Llama 3.1 and the Mixtral series, and on par with Gemini-1.5-Flash and GPT-4o-mini. Meanwhile, phi-3.5-Vision, a 4.2 billion parameter model derived from phi-3.5- mini, excels in reasoning tasks and is adept at handling both single-image and text prompts, as well as multi-image and text prompts. 1 Introduction The striking progress of AI in the last few years can be largely attributed to major efforts throughout the world towards scaling-up to ever-larger models and datasets. Large Language Models (LLMs) have steadily increased in size from a mere billion parameters just five years ago (GPT-2 had 1.5 billion parameters [RWC+19]) to trillion parameters today. The impetus for this effort originates in the seemingly predictable improvement one obtains by training large models, the so-called scaling laws [KMH+20, HBM+22, MRB+23]. However these laws assume a “fixed” data source. This assumption is now significantly disrupted by the existence of frontier LLMs themselves, which allow us to interact with data in novel ways. In our previous works on the phi models [GZA+23, LBE+23, JBA+23] it was shown that a combination of LLM-based filtering of publicly available web data, and LLM-created synthetic data, enable performance in smaller language models that were typically seen only in much larger models. For example our previous model trained on this data recipe, phi-2 (2.7B parameters), matched the performance of models 25 times larger trained on regular data. In this report we present a new model, phi-3-mini (3.8B parameters), trained for 3.3T tokens on larger and more advanced versions of the datasets used in phi-2. With its small size, phi-3-mini can easily be inferenced locally on a modern phone (see Figure 2), yet it achieves a quality that seems on-par with models such as Mixtral 8x7B [JSR+24] and GPT-3.5. User: Explain why it is surprising that one can build a language model small enough to fit on a phone, yet almost as powerful as ChatGPT. Just use one funny sentence. phi-3-mini: It’s like fitting a supercomputer in a flip phone, but instead of breaking the phone, it just breaks the internet with its tiny, yet mighty, linguistic prowess! User: Okay now more serious answer, and note that this was achieved solely by changing the training data. phi-3-mini: The development of a compact language model that rivals the capabilities of ChatGPT, while fitting on a phone, is a testament to the power of data-driven machine learning. By meticulously curating and optimizing the training dataset, researchers can significantly reduce the model’s size without compromising its performance. [...] 2 Technical Specifications Thephi-3-mini model is a transformer decoder architecture [VSP+17], with default context length 4 K. We also introduce a long context version via LongRope [DZZ+24a] that extends the context length to 128K, called phi-3-mini-128K. To best benefit the open source community, phi-3-mini is built upon a similar block structure as Llama-2 [TLI+23] and uses the same tokenizer with vocabulary size of 320641. This means that all packages developed for Llama-2 family of models can be directly adapted to phi-3-mini. The model uses 3072 hidden dimension, 32 heads and 32 layers. We trained using bfloat16 for a total of 3.3T tokens. The model is already chat-finetuned, and the chat template is as follows: <|user|> /n Question <|end|> /n <|assistant|> Thephi-3-small model (7B parameters) leverages the tiktoken tokenizer (for better multilingual tokenization) with a vocabulary size of 1003522and has default context length 8192. It follows the standard decoder architecture of a 7B model class, having 32 heads, 32 layers and a hidden size of 4096. We switched to GEGLU activation and used Maximal Update Parametrization (muP) [YHB+22] to tune hyperparameters on a small proxy model and transfer them to the target 7B model. Those helped ensure better performance and training stability. Also, the model leverages a grouped-query attention, with 4 queries sharing 1 key. To optimize the training and inference speed, we design a novel blocksparse attention module. For each attention head, the blocksparse attention enforces different sparsity patterns over KV cache. This ensures that all tokens are attended to on different heads for the given choice of sparsity. As illustrated in Figure 1, the context is then efficiently divided and conquered among attention heads, with significant KV cache reduction. To achieve actual deployment speed-up from the blocksparse design, we implemented highly efficient, yet flexible kernels for both training and inference. For training, we build a triton kernel based on Flash Attention [DFE+22]. For inference, we implemented a kernel for the prefilling phase and extended the paged attention kernel in vLLM for the decoding phase [KLZ+23]. Lastly, in phi-3-small architecture, we alternate dense attention layers and blocksparse attention layers to optimize KV cache savings while maintaining long context retrieval performance. An additional 10% multilingual data was also used for this model. Thephi-3.5-MoE adopts an Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture to selectively activate parts of modules on specific inputs to improve the model efficiency. It incorporates MoE layer as its feedforward models, employing the top2 routing among 16 expert networks. Particularly, each expert network is a separate GLU network and the routing module will selectively activate 2 expert networks out of the 16 expert networks for each token, leaving 16 ×3.8B model to have 6.6B activated parameters with 42B 1We remove BoS tokens and add some additional tokens for chat template. 2We remove unused tokens from the vocabulary.

Phi-3 Safety Post-Training: Aligning Language Models with a “Break-Fix” Cycle Microsoft Abstract Recent innovations in language model training have demonstrated that it is possible to create highly performant models that are small enough to run on a smartphone. As these models are deployed in an increasing number of domains, it is critical to ensure that they are aligned with human preferences and safety considerations. In this report, we present our methodology for safety aligning the Phi-3 series of language models. We utilized a “break-fix” cycle, performing multiple rounds of dataset curation, safety post-training, benchmarking, red teaming, and vulnerability identification to cover a variety of harm areas in both single and multi-turn scenarios. Our results indicate that this approach iteratively improved the performance of the Phi-3 models across a wide range of responsible AI benchmarks. Finally, we include additional red teaming strategies and evaluations that were used to test the safety behavior of Phi-3.5-mini and Phi-3.5-MoE, which were optimized for multilingual capabilities. 1 Introduction Given the computational cost associated with large language models (LLMs), there is increasing interest in developing smaller models with lower compute and memory requirements. Recent research has demonstrated that it is possible to create performant small language models (SLMs) by training on highly curated and synthetic datasets [GZA+23, LBE+23, JBA+23]. In April 2024, Microsoft released the Phi-3 series of SLMs, including Phi-3-mini (3.8B), Phi-3-small (7B), and Phi-3-medium (14B). For example, Phi-3-mini is small enough to run on a smartphone but achieves 69% on MMLU and 8.38 on MT-Bench, making it competitive with Mixtral 8x7B and GPT-3.5. [AJA+24]. Open-source SLMs enable an exciting array of on-device generative AI applications. At the same time, the proliferation of language models in an increasing number of domains underscores the importance of aligning models to human preferences and safety considerations. In this report, we present our approach to aligning the Phi-3 series of language models. We utilized a “break-fix” cycle that relies on multiple rounds of vulnerability identification and safety post-training. In the sections that follow, we detail our methodology, quantitative benchmarks, and red teaming results. 2 Safety Alignment 2.1 Approach Microsoft adopted an iterative approach to safety post-training that consisted of five main stages: 1.Safety Dataset Curation: We utilized existing publicly available datasets with various modifications and generated additional datasets based on feedback from the AI Red Team for further safety post-training. 2.Safety Post-Training: The safety datasets mixed with standard preference datasets were used in both the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO) [RSM+23] stages. 3.Quantitative and Qualitative RAI Evaluations: A wide spectrum of responsible AI (RAI) evaluations, described in detail below, were considered to select release candidates (RCs) to share with the AI Red Team. 4.AI Red Teaming: The release candidates were shared with a centralized and independent AI Red Team (AIRT), which leveraged a variety of adversarial techniques to probe models for harmful content. The red teaming strategy is described below. 5.Vulnerability Identification: Based on the RAI evaluations and AIRT findings, potential vulnerabilities are identified to inform further safety post-training. As illustrated by Figure 1, we repeated this cycle multiple times and gradually fine-tuned the Phi-3 models to generate safe responses in a variety of contexts. We found that this iterative “break-fix” approach made it possible to mitigate many more risks than what can typically be achieved by a single fine-tuning job. In addition to RAI benchmarks, we monitored multiple performance metrics to ensure that safety post-training did not degrade the quality of generated text. The datasets, red teaming strategies, and evaluation benchmarks used are detailed in the sections below.

Jamba: A Hybrid Transformer-Mamba Language Model Opher Lieber∗Barak Lenz∗Hofit Bata Gal Cohen Jhonathan Osin Itay Dalmedigos Erez Safahi Shaked Meirom Yonatan Belinkov Shai Shalev-Shwartz Omri Abend Raz Alon Tomer Asida Amir Bergman Roman Glozman Michael Gokhman Avshalom Manevich Nir Ratner Noam Rozen Erez Schwartz Mor Zusman Yoav Shoham Abstract We present Jamba, a new base large language model based on a novel hybrid Transformer-Mamba mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture. Specifically, Jamba interleaves blocks of Transformer and Mamba layers, enjoying the benefits of both model families. MoE is added in some of these layers to increase model capacity while keeping active parameter usage manageable. This flexible architecture allows resource- and objective-specific configurations. In the particular configuration we have implemented, we end up with a powerful model that fits in a single 80GB GPU. Built at large scale, Jamba provides high throughput and small memory footprint compared to vanilla Transformers, and at the same time state-of-the-art performance on standard language model benchmarks and long-context evaluations. Remarkably, the model presents strong results for up to 256K tokens context length. We study various architectural decisions, such as how to combine Transformer and Mamba layers, and how to mix experts, and show that some of them are crucial in large scale modeling. We also describe several interesting properties of these architectures which the training and evaluation of Jamba have revealed, and plan to release checkpoints from various ablation runs, to encourage further exploration of this novel architecture. We make the weights of our implementation of Jamba publicly available under a permissive license. 1 Introduction We introduce Jamba, a new publicly available large language model. Jamba is based on a novel hybrid architecture, which combines Transformer layers [ 51] with Mamba layers [ 17], a recent state-space model [ 18,19], as well as a mixture-of-experts (MoE) module [ 14,46]. Jamba thus combines two orthogonal architectural designs that together give it improved performance and higher throughput, while maintaining a manageable memory footprint. The 7B-based Jamba model (12B active parameters, 52B total available parameters) we are releasing was designed to fit in a single 80GB GPU, but the Jamba architecture supports other design choices, depending on one’s hardware and performance requirements. The fundamental novelty of Jamba is its hybrid Transformer-Mamba architecture (though see mention below of recent related efforts). Despite the immense popularity of the Transformer as the predominant architecture for language models, it suffers from two main drawbacks. First, its high memory and compute requirements hinders the processing of long contexts, where the key-value (KV) cache size becomes a limiting factor. Second, its lack of a single summary state entails slow inference and low throughput, since each generated token performs a computation on the entire context. In contrast, older recurrent neural network (RNN) models, which summarize an arbitrarily long context in a single hidden state, do not suffer from these limitations. RNN models have their own shortcomings, however. They are costly to train since training cannot be parallelized across time steps. And they struggle with long distance relationships, which the hidden state captures to only a limited extent. Recent state space models (SSMs) like Mamba are more efficient to train than RNNs and are more capable at handling long distance relationships, but still lag behind the performance of comparably sized Transformer language models. Taking advantage of both model families, Jamba combines Transformer and Mamba layers, at a certain ratio. Varying the ratio of Transformer/Mamba layers allows balancing memory usage, efficient training, and long context capabilities. A few other recent attempts to combine Attention and SSM modules are worth noting. [ 55] mixes an S4 layer [ 18] with a local attention layer, followed by a sequence of local attention layers; it shows experiments with small models and simple tasks. [ 17] reports that interleaving Mamba and attention layers is only slightly better than pure Mamba in terms of perplexity, with models up to 1.3B parameters. [ 37] starts with an SSM layer followed by chunk-based Transformers, with models up to 1.3B showing improved perplexity. [ 13] adds an SSM layer before the self-attention in a Transformer layer, while [43] adds the SSM after the self-attention, both showing improvements on speech recognition. [ 36] replaces the MLP layers in the Transformer by Mamba layers, and shows benefits in simple tasks. These efforts are different from Jamba both in the particular way in which the SSM component is mixed with the attention one, and in the scale of implementation. Closest are perhaps H3 [ 15], a specially designed SSM that enables induction capabilities, and a generalization called Hyena [ 39]. The former proposed a hybrid architecture that replaces the second and middle layers with self-attention, and was implemented with up to 2.7B parameters and 400B training tokens. However, as shown in [ 17], its perfomance lags that of pure Mamba. Based on Hyena, StripedHyena [40] interleaves attention and SSM layers in a 7B parameter model. However, it lags behind the Attention-only Mistral-7B [ 23]. All of this renders Jamba the first production-grade Attention-SSM hybrid model. Scaling the hybrid Jamba architecture required overcoming several obstacles, which we dicsuss in Section 6. Jamba also includes MoE layers [ 14,46], which allow increasing the model capacity (total number of available parameters) without increasing compute requirements (number of active parameters). MoE is a flexible approach that enables training extremely large models with strong performance [ 24]. In Jamba, MoE is applied to some of the MLP layers. The more MoE layers, and the more experts in each MoE layer, the larger the total number of model parameters. In contrast, the more experts we use at each forward pass, the larger the number of active parameters as well as the compute requirement. In our implementation of Jamba, we apply MoE at every other layer, with 16 experts and the top-2 experts used at each token (a more detailed discussion of the model architecture is provided below). We evaluated our implementation of Jamba on a wide range of benchmarks and found it performs comparably to Mixtral-8x7B [ 24], which has a similar number of parameters, and also to the larger Llama-2 70B [ 50]. In addition, our model supports a context length of 256K tokens – the longest supported context length for production-grade publicly available models. On long-context evaluations, Jamba outperformes Mixtral on most of the evaluated datasets. At the same time, Jamba is extremely efficient; for example, its throughput is 3x that of Mixtral-8x7B for long contexts. Moreover, our model fits in a single GPU (with 8bit weights) even with contexts of over 128K tokens, which is impossible with similar-size attention-only models such as Mixtral-8x7B. Somewhat unusual for a new architecture, we release Jamba (12B active parameters, 52B total available parameters) under Apache 2.0 license: https://huggingface.co/ai21labs/Jamba-v0.1. We do so since we feel that the novel architecture of Jamba calls for further study, experimentation, and optimization by the community. Our design was based on various ablation experiments we conducted to explore the effect of different tradeoffs and design choices, and insights gleaned from those. These ablations were performed at scales of up to 7B parameters, and training runs of up to 250B tokens. We plan to release model checkpoints from these runs.

Important notice: The Jamba model released is a pretrained base model, which did not go through alignment or instruction tuning, and does not have moderation mechanisms. It should not be used in production environments or with end users without additional adaptation. 2 Model Architecture Jamba is a hybrid decoder architecture that mixes Transformer layers [ 51] with Mamba layers [ 17], a recent state-space model (SSM) [ 18,19], in addition to a mixture-of-experts (MoE) module [ 14,46]. We call the combination of these three elements a Jamba block. See Figure 1 for an illustration. Combining Transformer, Mamba, and MoE elements allows flexibility in balancing among the sometimes conflicting objectives of low memory usage, high throughput, and high quality. In terms of memory usage, note that comparing the total size of the model parameters can be misleading. In an MoE model, the number of active parameters that participate in any given forward step may be much smaller than the total number of parameters. Another important consideration is the KV cache – the memory required to store the attention keys and values in the context. When scaling Transformer models to long contexts, the KV cache becomes a limiting factor. Trading off attention layers for Mamba layers reduces the total size of the KV cache. Our architecture aims to provide not only a small number of active parameters but also an 8x smaller KV cache compared to a vanilla Transformer. Table 1 compares Jamba with recent publicly available models, showing its advantage in maintaining a small KV cache even with 256K token contexts.

PANGU-: TOWARDS TRILLION PARAMETER LANGUAGE MODEL WITH SPARSE HETEROGENEOUS COMPUTING TECHNICAL REPORT Xiaozhe Ren1Pingyi Zhou1Xinfan Meng1Xinjing Huang2Yadao Wang1 Weichao Wang1Pengfei Li1Xiaoda Zhang2Alexander Podolskiy1Grigory Arshinov1 Andrey Bout1Irina Piontkovskaya1Jiansheng Wei1Xin Jiang1 Teng Su2Qun Liu1Jun Yao1 1Noah’s Ark Lab, Huawei Technologies 2Distributed and Parallel Software Lab, Huawei Technologies ABSTRACT The scaling of large language models has greatly improved natural language understanding, generation, and reasoning. In this work, we develop a system that trained a trillion-parameter language model on a cluster of Ascend 910 AI processors2and MindSpore framework3, and present the language model with 1.085T parameters named PanGu- . With parameter inherent from PanGu- [1], we extend the dense Transformer model to sparse one with Random Routed Experts (RRE), and efficiently train the model over 329B tokens by using Expert Computation and Storage Separation (ECSS). This resulted in a 6.3x increase in training throughput through heterogeneous computing. Our experimental findings show that PanGu- provides state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot learning of various Chinese NLP downstream tasks. Moreover, it demonstrates strong abilities when fine-tuned in application data of open-domain dialogue, question answering, machine translation and code generation. Keywords Large Language Models Distributed Training Natural Language Processing 1 Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) [ 2,3,1,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, etc.] have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities and potential in the areas of natural language understanding, generation and reasoning. By utilizing vast amount of textual data, the performance of language models scales up with compute budget and model parameters, demonstrating strong zero/few-shot learning abilities or even emergence abilities [ 4,11]. Several large language models with hundreds of billion parameters have been published since GPT-3 [ 2], including but not limited to Megatron-Turing NLG [ 12], PanGu-[1], ERNIE 3.0 Titan [ 8], Gopher [ 5], PaLM [ 4], OPT [ 6], Bloom [ 10], and GLM-130B [ 9]. Researchers start to build even larger language models with more than one trillion parameters. Typically, this is accomplished by leveraging sparsely-activated models such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) [ 13]. Among the trillion-parameter models currently in existence, there are several noteworthy work such as Switch-C [ 14], GLaM [ 15], MoE-1.1T [ 16], Wu Dao 2.0 [17], and M6-10T [ 18]. However, only a select few have published comprehensive evaluation results over a wide range of tasks while simultaneously achieving anticipated performance. In our experience, the primary difficulty lies in the scaling efficiency. Equal Contribution TECHNICAL REPORT - M ARCH 21, 2023 Recent studies on the scaling laws of language models [ 19,20,21] demonstrate the necessity of training LLMs with sufficient amount of training data and corresponding compute budget to achieve optimal performance. Therefore, one of the main motivation for this work is to design a scalable model architecture and an efficient distributed training system that can consume the data with high training throughput. •Model Scaling. Model performance of LLMs is expected to scale up with larger model size. Comparing to the expensive computational cost for training dense Transformer model, sparse architectures such as Mixtureof-Experts (MoE) [ 13,14,15,22] are considered to be an appealing choice to scale model size up without incuring linear increase in computational cost. However, MoE models suffer from the problems such as unbalanced workload and all-to-all communication latency. Moreover, how to extend existing dense model with MoE and how many experts to allocate in each layer remain open problems. Therefore, designing a trillion parameter sparse model with high performance and training efficiency is a significant yet challenging task. •System Scaling. Frameworks such as DeepSpeed4have been proposed to support training trillion parameter models. In practice, the main barrier often lies on limited compute budget, or more specifically the number of accelerating devices (e.g., GPU, NPU, TPU) that can be used. By utilizing techniques such as tensor parallelism [ 23], pipeline parallelism [ 24], zero redundancy optimizer [ 25] and rematerialization [ 26], practitioners can train trillion-parameter model with feasible batch sizes across thousands of accelerating devices. Alternatively, practitioners can reduce the amount of computation resources by utilizing heterogeneous computing techniques such as offloading some of the computation to host devices [ 27]. However, the current techniques inevitably hinder the training throughput due to slow bandwidth between the host and device as well as weak computing capabilities of CPUs compared to accelerating devices, which prevent feeding large language models with reasonably amount of data and achieving optimal performance. Therefore, how to efficiently scale the system performance with limited computation budget is critical to the performance of large language models. In this work, we present PanGu- , a large language model with sparse architecture containing 1.085 trillion parameters. We develop PanGu- model under the framework of MindSpore5and train it on a cluster with only 512 Ascend 910 AI Accelerators [ 28] with 329 billion tokens over 100 days. PanGu- inherent parameters from PanGu- [1] with Transformer decoder architecture and are extended via Random Routed Experts (RRE). Different from conventional MoE, RRE adopts two-level routing. At the first level experts are grouped by domain or task, and at the second level tokens are randomly and uniformly mapped to experts in each group without using any learnable gating function as in MoE. With the design of RRE, one can easily extract sub-models from the PanGu- for various downstream applications such as dialogue, translation, code generation or general nature language understanding. To make training system efficient and scalable, we propose Expert Computation and Storage Separation (ECSS) mechanism, which achieves 69905 tokens/s observed throughput in training 1.085 trillion PanGu- on cluster of 512 Ascend 910 accelerators, and reduces Host-to-Device and Device-to-Host communication as well as optimizer update computation by a large margin. As a whole, the training throughput is improved by 6.3x compared to the model of the same hyper-parameters but with MoE architecture. By consuming 329B tokens in more than 40 natural and programming languages, the sub-modal of PanGu- in Chinese domain significantly outperforms the previous SOTA models including PanGu- with 13B parameters and ERNIE 3.0 Titan [ 8] with 260B parameters over 16 downstream tasks in six categories in the zero-shot setting without any multitask finetuning or instruction tuning. We also test the performance of fine-tuned PanGu-  on several applications domain such as dialogue, machine translation and code generation. PanGu- outperforms the SOTA models in the corresponding areas. The rest of the technical report is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the design philosophy and the architecture of PanGu- model. Section 3 introduces the collection and organization of the dataset. Section 4 describes system design and acceleration techniques. Section 5 presents the experimental results of PanGu- model. 2 Model 2.1 Design Principles PanGu- aims to achieve the following goals. •Performance: state-of-the-art NLP performance across multiple domains and tasks. TECHNICAL REPORT - M ARCH 21, 2023 •Efficiency: training trillion parameters model with maximum system performance on a modest cluster. •Usability: extendable to various domains or tasks, without need of retraining the model from scratch. •Deployment: easily customizable and deployable in various real-world settings. Achieving all the above goals at the same time is very challenging. Considering the first goal, a language model that can generalize and perform well across domains should have a very large number of parameters and be trained on large amount of data according to the scaling law [ 19,20,21]. However, training such a large model also means that a high-end cluster is mandatory, which somehow contradicts with the second goal. And the larger scale of the model also leads to increasing cost in deploying the trained model, which is related to the fourth goal. Considering the high computational cost incurring during the training phase, we want the resulted model to be practically usable and efficient in many real applications. With this goal in mind, we propose to train the model in multiple domains and make it further extendable to any number of domains in a continuous learning paradigm, subject to the computation resource. During training phase, the trillion parameters PanGu- model is fed with data from multiple domains. However, in the deployment phase, it is often unnecessary or even impossible to host the trillion parameters model for every application. Therefore, a model that allows for the grouping and separation of its parameters based on various training and deployment setups offers significant advantages. 2.2 PanGu- Architecture 2.2.1 Overview Emb. 0 Domain Embedding Layer Data for domain 0Data for domain 1Data for domain 2Data for domain 3 Feed Forward Attention Attention Expert Expert Expert Expert Expert Expert Expert Expert Autoregressive Emb. 1 Emb. 2 Emb. 3M Transformer LayersN RRE layers

Yi: Open Foundation Models by 01.AI 01.AI Abstract We introduce the Yi model family, a series of language and multimodal models that demonstrate strong multi-dimensional capabilities. The Yi model family is based on 6B and 34B pretrained language models, then we extend them to chat models, 200K long context models, depth-upscaled models, and vision-language models. Our base models achieve strong performance on a wide range of benchmarks like MMLU, and our finetuned chat models deliver strong human preference rate on major evaluation platforms like AlpacaEval and Chatbot Arena. Building upon our scalable super-computing infrastructure and the classical transformer architecture, we attribute the performance of Yi models primarily to its data quality resulting from our data-engineering efforts. For pretraining, we construct 3.1 trillion tokens of English and Chinese corpora using a cascaded data deduplication and quality filtering pipeline. For finetuning, we polish a small scale (less than 10K) instruction dataset over multiple iterations such that every single instance has been verified directly by our machine learning engineers. For vision-language, we combine the chat language model with a vision transformer encoder and train the model to align visual representations to the semantic space of the language model. We further extend the context length to 200K through lightweight continual pretraining and demonstrate strong needle-in-a-haystack retrieval performance. We show that extending the depth of the pretrained checkpoint through continual pretraining further improves performance. We believe that given our current results, continuing to scale up model parameters using thoroughly optimized data will lead to even Contents 1 Introduction 3 2 Pretraining 4 2.1 Data Processing.................................... 4 2.2 Tokenization...................................... 5 2.3 Model Architecture.................................. 6 3 Finetuning 6 3.1 Data Preprocessing.................................. 6 3.2 Training Method................................... 7 4 Infrastructure 7 5 Safety 9 6 Evaluations 9 6.1 Base Model Performance............................... 9 6.1.1 Main Results................................. 9 6.1.2 Discussions.................................. 10 6.1.3 In-Context Learning Study.......................... 11 6.2 Chat Model Performance............................... 12 6.2.1 Automatic Evaluations............................ 12 6.2.2 Human Evaluations.............................. 12 7 Capability Extension 14 7.1 Long Context Modeling................................ 14 7.2 Vision-Language................................... 15 7.3 Depth Upscaling................................... 16 8 Final Discussions 18 A Author List and Contributions 19 1 Introduction Recent breakthroughs in large language models have revolutionized the whole field of artificial intelligence and potentially radiate across the entire human society. Our vision for large language models is to make them the next generation computational platform and empower the whole community with significantly amplified intelligence. As a step towards this mission, we present the Yi model series, 6B and 34B language models pretrained from scratch on 3.1T highly-engineered large amount of data, and finetuned on a small but meticulously polished alignment data. Due to the data quality resulting from our substantial engineering efforts, which we will detail in the upcoming sections, Yi achieves near GPT-3.5 benchmark scores and human preferences. In designing the Yi model series, we are mostly concerned on the following dimensions regarding model scale, data scale, and data quality: (1). when choosing model scale, the desiderata is to have small enough model that is feasible for inference on consumer-grade hardware like the RTX 4090 where the bounding factor is its limited 24G memory, yet still large enough with complex reasoning and emergent abilities. This is why we found 34B gives a nice performance-cost balance; (2). since 34B is smaller than the conventional 70B used by Chinchilla [ 30] and LLaMA [ 77], we increase the pretrain data scale to 3.1T tokens to compensate for the decreased compute flops. This makes the model-data scale combination fall into the post Chinchilla optimal regime [ 64], i.e., we overtrain the model on more tokens (3T) than the compute optimal (around 1T). The benefit is from the inference side, as we achieve stronger performance with reduced serving cost: after int4 [ 81] quantization, one can serve the 34B chat model on 24G GPU memory with almost no performance drop; (3). our data engineering principle is to promote quality over quantity for both pretraining and finetuning. The pretraining data quality is guaranteed by a sophisticated data cleaning pipeline with cascaded filtering methods and intentionally increased deduplication strength; (4). for finetuning data we heavily emphasize quality by handcrafting less than 10K instructions over multiple iterations based on user feedback. This approach significantly deviates from the quantity-scaling styled instruction tuning works like FLAN [ 9] and UltraChat [ 19], but aligns more with the handcrafting styled works like LIMA [94]. Our pretraining data cleaning system features a sophisticated filtering pipeline based on language, heuristic textual features, perplexity, semantics, topic, and safety, as well as a cascaded deduplication process based on paragraph, MinHash, and exact matching. This thorough pipeline leads to a much higher removal ratio than existing pipelines like CCNet [ 80], RefinedWeb [ 56] and RedPajama [ 13], which we believe is key to the success of data engineering. The underlying principle is although pretraining requires data scaling, one would like to make sure the data used are of high quality, rather than training the model on large raw data, i.e., we prefer 3T tokens over sophasticated engineering over 10T tokens without extensive filtering. Regarding the model architecture, we use standard implementation of the Transformer architecture with Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) [ 1], SwiGLU [ 68] activation, and RoPE with an adjusted base frequency (RoPE ABF) [ 82]. This design choice is the standard approach rooted from the Transformer original paper [ 78], later modified by GPT-3 and Chinchilla [ 30], then followed by LLaMA [ 77], Baichuan [ 84], Qwen [ 3] and many related works. To approach GPT-3.5-matching human preferences, our finetuning dataset is curated from carefully selected multi-turn instruction-response pairs, annotated directly by our team of machine learning engineers then polished over multiple iterations of user feedback. As mentioned above, the size of our finetuning dataset is less than 10K, but improved over and over again across the model development timeline. Benefiting from the dataset’s manageable size, we employed an extensive grid search to identify the optimal data composition, promote diversity, and discover effective hyperparameters. After 8-bit and 4-bit quantization, the final chat model can be deployed on consumer-grade GPUs nearly without performance degradation compared to the bf16 format. We further extend the Yi model capability from three dimensions: context scaling, vision-language adaptation, and depth-upscaling. To achive 200K context length, we continue pretrain the model on about 5B length-upsampled data, similar to the concurrent work in Fu et al. [22]. To adapt the model to vision-language tasks, we integrate a vision encoder and develop a multi-stage training method, following and improving the practice of Liu et al. [47]. We also study the effectiveness of depth-upscailng [ 38], i.e., making the model deeper by continual pretraining, and confirming its effectiveness to further improve model performance.
